* #### (2) Protective orders
  * Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the United States from seeking protective orders and from asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the disclosure of classified information, including the invocation of the military and State secrets privileges.

* #### (3) Treatment of classified information
  * #### (A) Use
    * The judge shall examine, ex parte and in camera, any evidence for which the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States or to the security of any individual because it would disclose classified information and neither the alien nor the public shall be informed of such evidence or its sources other than through reference to the summary provided pursuant to this paragraph.

      * If the revised unclassified summary is not approved by the court within 15 days of its submission pursuant to subparagraph (C), the removal hearing shall be terminated unless the judge makes the findings under clause (iii).

    * #### (iii) Findings
      * The findings described in this clause are, with respect to an alien, that—

        * (I) the continued presence of the alien in the United States would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person, and

        * (II) the provision of the summary would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person.

  * #### (E) Continuation of hearing without summary

The Government shall open the argument. The alien shall be permitted to reply. The Government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The judge may allow any part of the argument that refers to evidence received in camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and ex parte.

#### (g) Burden of proof
* In the hearing, it is the Government's burden to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the alien is subject to removal because the alien is an alien terrorist.

#### (h) Rules of evidence
* The Federal Rules of Evidence shall not apply in a removal hearing.
