### SUBCHAPTER II—ADMINISTRATIVE

### §3121. Procedure
* (a) In issuing obligations under sections 3102–3104 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe—

  * (1) whether an obligation is to be issued on an interest-bearing basis, a discount basis, or an interest-bearing and discount basis;

  * (2) regulations on the conditions under which the obligation will be offered for sale, including whether it will be offered for sale on a competitive or other basis;

  * (3) the offering price and interest rate;

  * (4) the method of computing the interest rate;

  * (5) the dates for paying principal and interest;

  * (6) the form and denominations of the obligations; and

  * (7) other conditions.


* (b)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation issued under this chapter and redeemable on demand of the owner or holder may be used to pay the United States Government for taxes imposed by it.

* (2) An obligation of the Government issued after March 3, 1971, under law may not be redeemed before its maturity to pay a tax imposed by the Government in an amount more than the fair market value of the obligation at the time of its redemption. This paragraph does not apply to a Treasury bill issued under section 3104 of this title.

* (c) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation authorized by this chapter may be issued in exchange for an obligation of an agency whose principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the Government at or before maturity.

* (d) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may issue registered bonds in exchange for and instead of coupon bonds that have been or may be issued. The registered bonds shall be similar in all respects to the registered bonds issued under a law authorizing the issue of coupon bonds offered for exchange.

* (e) A decision of the Secretary about an issue of obligations under sections 3102–3104 of this title is final.

* (f) The Secretary may accept voluntary services in carrying out the sale of public debt obligations.

* (g)(1) In this subsection, "registration-required obligation" means an obligation except an obligation—

  * (A) not of a type offered to the public; or

  * (B) having a maturity (at issue) of not more than one year.


* (2) Every registration-required obligation of the Government shall be in registered form. A book entry obligation is deemed to be in registered form if the right to principal and stated interest on the obligation may be transferred only through a book entry consistent with regulations of the Secretary.

* (3) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out this subsection when there is a nominee.

* (h)(1) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation standards for the safeguarding and use of obligations issued under this chapter, and obligations otherwise issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States. Such regulations shall apply only to a depository institution that is not a government securities broker or a government securities dealer and that holds such obligations as fiduciary, custodian, or otherwise for the account of a customer and not for its own account. Such regulations shall provide for the adequate segregation of obligations so held, including obligations which are purchased or sold subject to resale or repurchase.

* (2) Violation of a regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under section 5239(a) or (b) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 93(a) or (b)), section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 5(d)(2) or 5(d)(3) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, section 407(e) or 407(f) of the National Housing Act, or section 206(e) or 206(f) of the Federal Credit Union Act. Such an order may be issued with respect to a depository institution by its appropriate regulatory agency and with respect to a federally insured credit union by the National Credit Union Administration Board.

* (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect in any way the powers of such agencies under any other provision of law.

* (4) The Secretary shall, prior to adopting regulations under this subsection, determine with respect to each appropriate regulatory agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board, whether its rules and standards adequately meet the purposes of regulations to be promulgated under this subsection, and if the Secretary so determines, shall exempt any depository institution subject to such rules or standards from the regulations promulgated under this subsection.

* (5) As used in this subsection—

  * (A) "depository institution" has the meaning stated in clauses (i) through (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act and also includes a foreign bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank, and a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in the International Banking Act of 1978).

  * (B) "government securities broker" has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(43) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

  * (C) "government securities dealer" has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

  * (D) "appropriate regulatory agency" has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(34)(G) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

### §3122. Banks and trust companies as depositaries
* (a) The Secretary of the Treasury may designate incorporated banks and trust companies as depositaries for any part of proceeds of an obligation issued under this chapter. The Secretary may prescribe the conditions under which deposits may be made under this section, including the interest rate on amounts deposited and security requirements.

* (b) The Secretary may designate a bank or trust company that is a depositary under subsection (a) of this section as a fiscal agent of the United States Government in selling and delivering bonds and certificates of indebtedness issued by the Government.

### §3123. Payment of obligations and interest on the public debt
* (a) The faith of the United States Government is pledged to pay, in legal tender, principal and interest on the obligations of the Government issued under this chapter.

* (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay interest due or accrued on the public debt. As the Secretary considers expedient, the Secretary may pay in advance interest on the public debt by a period of not more than one year, with or without a rebate of interest on the coupons.

* (c)(1) The Secretary may issue a bond, note, or certificate of indebtedness authorized under this chapter whose principal and interest are payable in a foreign currency stated in the bond, note, or certificate. The Secretary may dispose of the bonds, notes, and certificates at a price that is at least par value without complying with section 3102(b)–(d) of this title.

* (2) In determining the dollar amount of bonds, notes, and certificates of indebtedness that may be issued under this chapter, the dollar equivalent of the amount of bonds, notes, and certificates payable in a foreign currency is determined by the par of the exchange value on the date of issue of the bonds, notes, or certificates as published by the Secretary under section 5151 of this title.

* (3) The Secretary may designate depositaries in foreign countries in which any part of the proceeds of bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness payable in the foreign currency may be deposited.

### §3124. Exemption from taxation
* (a) Stocks and obligations of the United States Government are exempt from taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State. The exemption applies to each form of taxation that would require the obligation, the interest on the obligation, or both, to be considered in computing a tax, except—

  * (1) a nondiscriminatory franchise tax or another nonproperty tax instead of a franchise tax, imposed on a corporation; and

  * (2) an estate or inheritance tax.


* (b) The tax status of interest on obligations and dividends, earnings, or other income from evidences of ownership issued by the Government or an agency and the tax treatment of gain and loss from the disposition of those obligations and evidences of ownership is decided under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.). An obligation that the Federal Housing Administration had agreed, under a contract made before March 1, 1941, to issue at a future date, has the tax exemption privileges provided by the authorizing law at the time of the contract. This subsection does not apply to obligations and evidences of ownership issued by the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a department, agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of the District, territory, or possession.

### §3125. Relief for lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced obligations
* (a) In this section, "obligation" means a direct obligation of the United States Government issued under law for valuable consideration, including bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, Treasury bills, and interim certificates issued for an obligation.

* (b) The Secretary of the Treasury may provide relief for the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of an obligation identified by number and description.

* (c)(1) An indemnity bond is required as a condition of relief if the obligation is payable to bearer or assigned so as to become payable to bearer and is not proven clearly to have been destroyed. The Secretary may prescribe for the indemnity bond the form, amount, and surety or security requirements.

* (2) Relief for interest coupons claimed to have been attached to an obligation may be provided only if the Secretary is satisfied that the coupons have not been paid and are destroyed or will not become the basis of a valid claim against the Government.

### §3126. Losses and relief from liability related to redeeming savings bonds and notes
* (a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, a loss resulting from a payment related to redeeming a savings bond or savings note shall be replaced out of the fund established by section 17303(a) of title 40. A Federal reserve bank, a paying agent allowed to make payments in redeeming a bond or note, or an officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury is relieved from liability to the United States Government for the loss when the Secretary decides that the loss did not result from the fault or negligence of the bank, paying agent, officer, or employee. The Secretary shall relieve the bank, agent, officer, or employee from liability when the Secretary decides that written notice of liability or potential liability has not been given to the bank, agent, officer, or employee by the Government within 10 years from the date of the erroneous payment. However, the Secretary may not relieve a paying agent of an assumed unconditional liability to the Government.

* (b) Section 17304(c) of title 40 applies to a decision of the Secretary made under this section. A recovery or repayment of a loss for which replacement is made out of the fund shall be credited to the fund and is available for the purposes for which the fund was established.

### §3127. Credit to officers, employees, and agents for stolen Treasury notes
* When an officer, employee, or agent of the United States Government authorized to receive, redeem, or cancel Treasury notes receives or pays a note that was stolen and put in circulation after it had been received or redeemed by an officer, employee, or agent authorized to receive or redeem the note, the Secretary of the Treasury may allow the officer, employee, or agent receiving or paying the stolen note a credit for the amount of the note. The Secretary may allow the credit only if the Secretary is satisfied that the note was received or paid in good faith and in exercising ordinary prudence.

### §3128. Proof of death to support payment
* A finding of death made by an officer or employee of the United States Government authorized by law to make the finding is sufficient proof of death to allow credit in the accounts of a Federal reserve bank or accountable official of the Department of the Treasury in a case involving the transfer, exchange, reissue, redemption, or payment of obligations of the Government, including obligations guaranteed by the Government for which the Secretary of the Treasury acts as transfer agent.

### §3129. Appropriation to pay expenses
* (a) Amounts to pay necessary expenses (including rent) for an issue of obligations authorized under this chapter are appropriated to the Secretary of the Treasury. However, the amount appropriated under this section may not be more than—

  * (1) .2 percent of the amount of bonds and notes authorized under this chapter;

  * (2) .1 percent of the amount of certificates of indebtedness authorized under section 3104 of this title; and

  * (3) .1 percent of the amount of certificates of indebtedness authorized under the First Liberty Bond Act.


* (b) An appropriation under this section is available for obligation only through the end of the fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the issue was made. During a period for which an appropriation for a specified amount is made for expenses for which this section makes an appropriation for an unspecified amount, only the appropriation for the specified amount is available for obligation.
