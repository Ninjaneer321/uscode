* (j)(1) For purposes of this subsection—

  * (A) the term "pay increase", as used with respect to an officer or employee in connection with a year, means the total increase in the rate of basic pay (expressed as a percentage) of such officer or employee, taking effect under section 731(b) and subsection (c)(3) in such year;
