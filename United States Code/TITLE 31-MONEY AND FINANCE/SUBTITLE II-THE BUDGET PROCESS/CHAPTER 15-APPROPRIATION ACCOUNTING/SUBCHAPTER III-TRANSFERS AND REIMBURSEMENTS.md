  * (1) another law authorizes the amount to be credited to some other appropriation or fund; or

  * (2) the head of the executive agency filling the order decides that replacement is not necessary, in which case, the amount received is deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.


* (c) This section does not affect other laws about working funds.
