### SUBCHAPTER II—NOAA UNDERSEA RESEARCH PROGRAM

### §3421. Program established
#### (a) In general
* The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall establish and maintain an undersea research program and shall designate a Director of that program.

#### (b) Purpose
* The purpose of the program is to increase scientific knowledge essential for the informed management, use, and preservation of oceanic, marine, and coastal areas and the Great Lakes.

### §3422. Powers of program Director
* The Director of the program, in carrying out the program, shall—

  * (1) cooperate with institutions of higher education and other educational marine and ocean science organizations, and shall make available undersea research facilities, equipment, technologies, information, and expertise to support undersea research efforts by these organizations;

  * (2) enter into partnerships, as appropriate and using existing authorities, with the private sector to achieve the goals of the program and to promote technological advancement of the marine industry; and

  * (3) coordinate the development of agency budgets and identify the items in their annual budget that support the activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2).

### §3423. Administrative structure
#### (a) In general
* The program shall be conducted through a national headquarters, a network of extramural regional undersea research centers that represent all relevant National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration regions, and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology.

#### (b) Direction
* The Director shall develop the overall direction of the program in coordination with a Council of Center Directors comprised of the directors of the extramural regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology. The Director shall publish a draft program direction document not later than 1 year after March 30, 2009, in the Federal Register for a public comment period of not less than 120 days. The Director shall publish a final program direction, including responses to the comments received during the public comment period, in the Federal Register within 90 days after the close of the comment period. The program director shall update the program direction, with opportunity for public comment, at least every 5 years.

### §3424. Research, exploration, education, and technology programs
#### (a) In general
* The following research, exploration, education, and technology programs shall be conducted through the network of regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology:

  * (1) Core research and exploration based on national and regional undersea research priorities.

  * (2) Advanced undersea technology development to support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's research mission and programs.

  * (3) Undersea science-based education and outreach programs to enrich ocean science education and public awareness of the oceans and Great Lakes.

  * (4) Development, testing, and transition of advanced undersea technology associated with ocean observatories, submersibles, advanced diving technologies, remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and new sampling and sensing technologies.

  * (5) Discovery, study, and development of natural resources and products from ocean, coastal, and aquatic systems.

#### (b) Operations
* The Director of the program, through operation of the extramural regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology, shall leverage partnerships and cooperative research with academia and private industry.

### §3425. Competitiveness
#### (a) Discretionary fund
* The Program shall allocate no more than 10 percent of its annual budget to a discretionary fund that may be used only for program administration and priority undersea research projects identified by the Director but not covered by funding available from centers.

#### (b) Competitive selection
* The Administrator shall conduct an initial competition to select the regional centers that will participate in the program 90 days after the publication of the final program direction under section 3423 of this title and every 5 years thereafter. Funding for projects conducted through the regional centers shall be awarded through a competitive, merit-reviewed process on the basis of their relevance to the goals of the program and their technical feasibility.
