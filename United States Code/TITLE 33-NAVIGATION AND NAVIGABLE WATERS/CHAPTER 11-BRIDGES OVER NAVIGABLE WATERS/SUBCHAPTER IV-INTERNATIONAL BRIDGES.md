Such consent shall be subject to (1) the approval of the proper authorities in the foreign country concerned; (2) the provisions of sections 491 to 494 and 495 to 498 of this title, except section 496 of this title, whether or not such bridge is to be built across or over any of the navigable waters of the United States; and (3) of the provisions of this subchapter.

### §535a. Congressional consent to State agreements with Canada and Mexico; Secretary of State's approval of agreements
* The consent of Congress is hereby granted for a State or a subdivision or instrumentality thereof to enter into agreements—

  * (1) with the Government of Canada, a Canadian Province, or a subdivision or instrumentality of either, in the case of a bridge connecting the United States and Canada, or

  * (2) with the Government of Mexico, a Mexican State, or a subdivision or instrumentality of either, in the case of a bridge connecting the United States and Mexico,


* for the construction, operation, and maintenance of such bridge in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subchapter. The effectiveness of such agreement shall be conditioned on its approval by the Secretary of State.

### §535b. Presidential approval; recommendations of Federal officials
* No bridge may be constructed, maintained, and operated as provided in section 535 of this title unless the President has given his approval thereto. In the course of determining whether to grant such approval, the President shall secure the advice and recommendations of (1) the United States section of the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico, in the case of a bridge connecting the United States and Mexico, and (2) the heads of such departments and agencies of the Federal Government as he deems appropriate to determine the necessity for such bridge.

### §535c. Approval of Secretary; commencement and completion requirements; extension of time limits
* The approval of the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, as required by section 491 of this title, shall be given only subsequent to the President's approval, as provided for in section 535b of this title, and shall be null and void unless the construction of the bridge is commenced within two years and completed within five years from the date of the Secretary's approval: _Provided, however_, That the Secretary, for good cause shown, may extend for a reasonable time either or both of the time limits herein provided.

### §535e. Ownership
#### (a) Sale, assignment, or transfer; approval of Secretary
* Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to prevent the individual, corporation, or other entity to which, pursuant to this subchapter, authorization has been given to construct, operate, and maintain an international bridge and the approaches thereto, from selling, assigning, or transferring the rights, powers, and privileges conferred by this subchapter: _Provided_, That such sale, assignment, or transfer shall be subject to approval by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating.

#### (b) State status of original applicant upon acquisition of right, title, and interest after termination of private entity licenses, contracts, or orders
