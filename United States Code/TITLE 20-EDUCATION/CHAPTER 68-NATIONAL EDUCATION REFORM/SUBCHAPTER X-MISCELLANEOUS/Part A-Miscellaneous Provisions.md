### PART A—MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

### §6061. School prayer
* No funds authorized to be appropriated under this chapter may be used by any State or local educational agency to adopt policies that prevent voluntary prayer and meditation in public schools.

### §6062. Funding for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] was established with the commitment of forty percent Federal funding but currently receives only eight percent Federal funding;

  * (2) this funding shortfall is particularly burdensome to school districts and schools in low-income areas which serve higher than average proportions of students with disabilities and have fewer local resources to contribute; and

  * (3) it would cost the Federal Government approximately $10,000,000,000 each year to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

#### (b) Sense of Congress
* It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Government should provide States and communities with adequate resources under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] as soon as reasonably possible, through the reallocation of noneducation funds within the current budget monetary constraints.

* Assessments developed with funds under subchapter III of this chapter may be used for decisions regarding graduation, grade promotion, or retention of students only on the condition that students have been prepared in the content for which the students are being assessed.

### §6066. Public schools
