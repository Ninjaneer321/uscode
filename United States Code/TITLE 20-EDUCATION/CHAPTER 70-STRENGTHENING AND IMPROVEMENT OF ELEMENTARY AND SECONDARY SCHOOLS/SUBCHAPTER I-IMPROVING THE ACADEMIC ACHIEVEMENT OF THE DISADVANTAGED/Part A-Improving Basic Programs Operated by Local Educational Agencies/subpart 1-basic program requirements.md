      * (ii) such student's achievement on such end-of-course assessment is used for purposes of subsection (c)(4)(B)(i), in lieu of such student's achievement on the mathematics assessment required under subparagraph (B)(v)(I)(aa), and such student is counted as participating in the assessment for purposes of subsection (c)(4)(B)(vi); and

      * (iii) in high school, such student takes a mathematics assessment pursuant to subparagraph (B)(v)(I)(bb) that—

        * (I) is any end-of-course assessment or other assessment that is more advanced than the assessment taken by such student under clause (i) of this subparagraph; and

* #### (4) Description of system
  * The statewide accountability system described in paragraph (1) shall be based on the challenging State academic standards for reading or language arts and mathematics described in subsection (b)(1) to improve student academic achievement and school success. In designing such system to meet the requirements of this part, the State shall carry out the following:

  * #### (A) Establishment of long-term goals

      * (i) for all students and separately for each subgroup of students in the State—

        * (I) for, at a minimum, improved—

        * (III) that, for subgroups of students who are behind on the measures described in items (aa) and (bb) of subclause (I), take into account the improvement necessary on such measures to make significant progress in closing statewide proficiency and graduation rate gaps; and


      * (ii) for English learners, for increases in the percentage of such students making progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the State and measured by the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G), within a State-determined timeline.

  * #### (B) Indicators
    * Except for the indicator described in clause (iv), annually measure, for all students and separately for each subgroup of students, the following indicators:

      * (i) For all public schools in the State, based on the long-term goals established under subparagraph (A), academic achievement—

        * (I) as measured by proficiency on the annual assessments required under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I); and

        * (II) at the State's discretion, for each public high school in the State, student growth, as measured by such annual assessments.

        * (II) at the State's discretion, the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.


      * (iv) For public schools in the State, progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the State and measured by the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G), within a State-determined timeline for all English learners—

        * (I) in each of the grades 3 through 8; and

        * (II) in the grade for which such English learners are otherwise assessed under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I) during the grade 9 through grade 12 period, with such progress being measured against the results of the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G) taken in the previous grade.


      * (v)(I) For all public schools in the State, not less than one indicator of school quality or student success that—

        * (aa) allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance;

        * (bb) is valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide (with the same indicator or indicators used for each grade span, as such term is determined by the State); and

        * (cc) may include one or more of the measures described in subclause (II).

    * (i) In the case of a student who has not attended the same school within a local educational agency for at least half of a school year, the performance of such student on the indicators described in clauses (i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of subparagraph (B)—

      * (I) may not be used in the system of meaningful differentiation of all public schools as described in subparagraph (C) for such school year; and

      * (II) shall be used for the purpose of reporting on the State and local educational agency report cards under subsection (h) for such school year.


    * (ii) In the case of a high school student who has not attended the same school within a local educational agency for at least half of a school year and has exited high school without a regular high school diploma and without transferring to another high school that grants a regular high school diploma during such school year, the local educational agency shall, in order to calculate the graduation rate pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), assign such student to the high school—

      * (I) at which such student was enrolled for the greatest proportion of school days while enrolled in grades 9 through 12; or

      * (II) in which the student was most recently enrolled.

    * #### (ii) Priority
      * In providing students the option to transfer to another public school, the local educational agency shall give priority to the lowest-achieving children from low-income families, as determined by the local educational agency for the purposes of allocating funds to schools under section 6313(a)(3) of this title.

    * #### (iii) Treatment
      * A student who uses the option to transfer to another public school shall be enrolled in classes and other activities in the public school to which the student transfers in the same manner as all other students at the public school.

    * #### (iv) Special rule
      * A local educational agency shall permit a student who transfers to another public school under this paragraph to remain in that school until the student has completed the highest grade in that school.

    * #### (v) Funding for transportation

  * #### (D) Special rule
    * The State educational agency, based on the State's differentiation of schools under subsection (c)(4)(C) for school year 2017–2018, shall notify local educational agencies of any schools served by the local educational agency in which any subgroup of students, on its own, would lead to identification under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i)(I) using the State's methodology under subsection (c)(4)(D), after which notification of such schools under this paragraph shall result from differentiation of schools pursuant to subsection (c)(4)(C)(iii).
