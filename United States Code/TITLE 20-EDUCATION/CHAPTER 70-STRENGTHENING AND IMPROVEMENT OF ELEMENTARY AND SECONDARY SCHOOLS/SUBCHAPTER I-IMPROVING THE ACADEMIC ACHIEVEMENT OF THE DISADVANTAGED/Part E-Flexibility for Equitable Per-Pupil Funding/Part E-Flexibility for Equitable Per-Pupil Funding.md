  * #### (A) In general
    * A local educational agency's school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations shall—

      * (i) except as allowed under clause (iv), allocate a significant portion of funds, including State and local education funds and eligible Federal funds, to the school level based on the number of students in a school and a formula developed by the agency under this section that determines per-pupil weighted amounts;

      * (iii) ensure that each high-poverty school receives, in the first year of the demonstration agreement—

        * (I) more per-pupil funding, including from Federal, State, and local sources, for low-income students than such funding received for low-income students in the year prior to entering into a demonstration agreement under this section; and

        * (II) at least as much per-pupil funding, including from Federal, State, and local sources, for English learners as such funding received for English learners in the year prior to entering into a demonstration agreement under this section;


      * (iv) be used to allocate to schools a significant percentage, which shall be a percentage agreed upon during the application process, of all the local educational agency's State and local education funds and eligible Federal funds; and
