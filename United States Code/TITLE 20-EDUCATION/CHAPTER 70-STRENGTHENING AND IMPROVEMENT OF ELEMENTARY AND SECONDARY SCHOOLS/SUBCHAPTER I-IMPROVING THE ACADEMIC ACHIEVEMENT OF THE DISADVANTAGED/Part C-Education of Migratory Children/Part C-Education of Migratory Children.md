  * (3) To ensure that migratory children receive full and appropriate opportunities to meet the same challenging State academic standards that all children are expected to meet.

  * (4) To help migratory children overcome educational disruption, cultural and language barriers, social isolation, various health-related problems, and other factors that inhibit the ability of such children to succeed in school.

### §6392. Program authorized

#### (c) Allocation to Puerto Rico
* #### (1) In general
  * For each fiscal year, the grant that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be eligible to receive under this part shall be the amount determined by multiplying the number of children who would be counted under subsection (a)(1) if such subsection applied to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by the product of—

    * (A) the percentage that the average per-pupil expenditure in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is of the lowest average per-pupil expenditure of any of the 50 States, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3); and

  * #### (B) Reallocation
    * If additional funds become available for making such payments for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate such funds to States in amounts that the Secretary determines will best carry out the purposes of this part.

* #### (2) Special rule
  * #### (A) Further reductions
    * The Secretary shall further reduce the amount of any grant to a State under this part for any fiscal year if the Secretary determines, based on available information on the numbers and needs of migratory children in the State and the program proposed by the State to address such needs, that such amount exceeds the amount required under section 6394 of this title.

#### (e) Consortium arrangements
* #### (1) In general
  * In the case of a State that receives a grant of $1,000,000 or less under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the State educational agency to determine whether consortium arrangements with another State or other appropriate entity would result in delivery of services in a more effective and efficient manner.

#### (g) Nonparticipating States
* In the case of a State desiring to receive an allocation under this part for a fiscal year that did not receive an allocation for the previous fiscal year or that has been participating for less than 3 consecutive years, the Secretary shall calculate the State's number of identified migratory children aged 3 through 21 for purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A) by using the most recent data available that identifies the migratory children residing in the State until data is available to calculate the 3-year average number of such children in accordance with such subsection.
