### SUBCHAPTER VII—IMPACT AID

### §7701. Purpose
* In order to fulfill the Federal responsibility to assist with the provision of educational services to federally connected children in a manner that promotes control by local educational agencies with little or no Federal or State involvement, because certain activities of the Federal Government, such as activities to fulfill the responsibilities of the Federal Government with respect to Indian tribes and activities under section 4001 of title 50, place a financial burden on the local educational agencies serving areas where such activities are carried out, and to help such children meet the same challenging State academic standards, it is the purpose of this subchapter to provide financial assistance to local educational agencies that—

  * (1) experience a substantial and continuing financial burden due to the acquisition of real property by the United States;

  * (2) educate children who reside on Federal property and whose parents are employed on Federal property;

  * (3) educate children of parents who are in the military services and children who live in low-rent housing;

  * (4) educate heavy concentrations of children whose parents are civilian employees of the Federal Government and do not reside on Federal property; or

  * (5) need special assistance with capital expenditures for construction activities because of the enrollments of substantial numbers of children who reside on Federal lands and because of the difficulty of raising local revenue through bond referendums for capital projects due to the inability to tax Federal property.

### §7702. Payments relating to Federal acquisition of real property
#### (a) In general
* Where the Secretary, after consultation with any local educational agency and with the appropriate State educational agency, determines—

  * (1) that the United States owns Federal property in the local educational agency, and that such property—

    * (A) has been acquired by the United States since 1938;

    * (B) was not acquired by exchange for other Federal property in the local educational agency which the United States owned before 1939; and

    * (C) had an assessed value according to original records (including facsimiles or other reproductions of those records) documenting the assessed value of such property (determined as of the time or times when so acquired) prepared by the local officials referred to in subsection (b)(3) or, when such original records are not available due to unintentional destruction (such as natural disaster, fire, flooding, pest infestation, or deterioration due to age), other records, including Federal agency records, local historical records, or other records that the Secretary determines to be appropriate and reliable, aggregating 10 percent or more of the assessed value of—

      * (i) all real property in the local educational agency (similarly determined as of the time or times when such Federal property was so acquired); or

      * (ii) all real property in the local educational agency as assessed in the first year preceding or succeeding acquisition, whichever is greater, only if—

        * (I) the assessment of all real property in the local educational agency is not made at the same time or times that such Federal property was so acquired and assessed; and

        * (II) State law requires an assessment be made of property so acquired; and


  * (2) that such agency is not being substantially compensated for the loss in revenue resulting from such ownership by increases in revenue accruing to the agency from the conduct of Federal activities with respect to such Federal property,


* then such agency shall be eligible to receive the amount described in subsection (b) or (h).

#### (b) Amount
* #### (1) In general
  * (A)(i)(I) Subject to subclauses (II) and (III), the amount that a local educational agency shall be paid under subsection (a) for a fiscal year shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (2).

  * (II) Except as provided in subclause (III), the Secretary may not reduce the amount of a payment under this section to a local educational agency for a fiscal year by (aa) the amount equal to the amount of revenue, if any, the agency received during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property eligible under this section and located in a school district served by the agency, including amounts received from any Federal department or agency (other than the Department of Education) from such activities, by reason of receipt of such revenue, or (bb) any other amount by reason of receipt of such revenue.

  * (III) If the amount equal to the sum of (aa) the proposed payment under this section to a local educational agency for a fiscal year and (bb) the amount of revenue described in subclause (II)(aa) received by the agency during the previous fiscal year, exceeds the maximum amount the agency is eligible to receive under this section for the fiscal year involved, then the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the proposed payment under this section by an amount equal to such excess amount.

  * (ii) For purposes of clause (i), the amount of revenue that a local educational agency receives during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property shall not include payments received by the agency from the Secretary of Defense to support—

    * (I) the operation of a domestic dependent elementary or secondary school; or

    * (II) the provision of a free public education to dependents of members of the Armed Forces residing on or near a military installation.


  * (B) If funds appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title are insufficient to pay the amount determined under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall calculate the payment for each eligible local educational agency in accordance with subsection (h).

  * (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a local educational agency may not be paid an amount under this section that, when added to the amount such agency receives under section 7703(b) of this title, exceeds the maximum amount that such agency is eligible to receive for such fiscal year under section 7703(b)(1)(C) of this title, or the maximum amount that such agency is eligible to receive for such fiscal year under this section, whichever is greater.

* #### (2) Application of current levied real property tax rate
  * In calculating the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall apply the current levied real property tax rate for current expenditures levied by fiscally independent local educational agencies, or imputed for fiscally dependent local educational agencies, to the current annually determined estimated taxable value of such acquired Federal property.

* #### (3) Determination of taxable value for eligible Federal property
  * #### (A) In general
    * In determining the estimated taxable value of such acquired Federal property for fiscal year 2010 and each succeeding fiscal year, the Secretary shall—

      * (i) first determine the total taxable value for the purpose of levying property tax for school purposes for current expenditures of real property located within the boundaries of such local educational agency;

      * (ii) then determine the per acre value of the eligible Federal property by dividing the total taxable value as determined in clause (i) by the difference between the total acres located within the boundaries of the local educational agency and the number of Federal acres eligible under this section; and

      * (iii) then determine the total taxable value of the eligible Federal property by multiplying the per acre value as calculated under clause (ii) by the number of Federal acres eligible under this section.

  * #### (B) Special rule
    * In the case of Federal property eligible under this section that is within the boundaries of 2 or more local educational agencies that are eligible under this section, any of such agencies may ask the Secretary to calculate (and the Secretary shall calculate) the taxable value of the eligible Federal property that is within its boundaries by—

      * (i) first calculating the per-acre value of the eligible Federal property separately for each eligible local educational agency that shared the Federal property, as provided in subparagraph (A)(ii);

      * (ii) then averaging the resulting per-acre values of the eligible Federal property from each eligible local educational agency that shares the Federal property; and

      * (iii) then applying the average per-acre value to determine the total taxable value of the eligible Federal property under subparagraph (A)(iii) for the requesting local educational agency.

#### (c) Applicability to Tennessee Valley Authority Act
* For the purpose of this section, any real property with respect to which payments are being made under section 13 of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 [16 U.S.C. 831l] shall not be regarded as Federal property.

#### (d) Ownership by United States

    * (B) requires that the property be used in perpetuity for the public purposes for which the property was conveyed;

    * (C) requires the grantee of the property to report to the Federal Government (or its agent) regarding information on the use of the property;

    * (D) except with the approval of the Federal Government (or its agent), prohibits the sale, lease, assignment, or other disposal of the property unless such sale, lease, assignment, or other disposal is to another eligible government agency; and

    * (E) reserves to the Federal Government a right of reversion at any time the Federal Government (or its agent) deems it necessary for the national defense.

#### (e) Local educational agency containing Forest Service land and serving certain counties

  * #### (C) Insufficient appropriations
    * If the amount appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title is insufficient to pay the full amount determined under this paragraph for all eligible local educational agencies for the fiscal year, then the Secretary shall ratably reduce the payment to each local educational agency under this paragraph.

* #### (2) Foundation payments for new applicants
  * #### (A) First year
    * From any amounts remaining after making payments under paragraph (1) and subsection (i)(1) for the fiscal year involved, the Secretary shall make a payment, in an amount determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), to each local educational agency that the Secretary determines eligible for a payment under this section for a fiscal year after fiscal year 2009 and that did not receive a payment under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year for which such agency was determined eligible for such payment.

      * (iii) Multiply the amount determined under clause (ii) by 90 percent.

  * #### (D) Insufficient funds
    * If the amount appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title is insufficient to pay the full amount determined under this paragraph for all eligible local educational agencies for the fiscal year, then the Secretary shall ratably reduce the payment to each local educational agency under this paragraph.

  * For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b), the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:

    * (A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.

    * (B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.

    * (C) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has—

      * (i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 5,000; and

      * (ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.

    * Beginning in fiscal year 2014, in determining the amount of a payment for a local educational agency for children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i), the Secretary shall consider those children as if they were children described in paragraph (1)(B) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of Defense, that those children would have resided in housing on Federal property if the housing was not undergoing renovation or rebuilding. The total number of children treated as children described in paragraph (1)(B) shall not exceed the lessor of—

      * (i) the total number of children eligible under paragraph (1)(B) for the year prior to the initiation of the housing project on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding; or

      * (i) shall require the local educational agency to provide certification from an appropriate official of the Department of Defense that the property is being used to provide military housing; and

      * (ii) shall reduce the amount of the payment under this section by an amount equal to the amount of revenue from such taxation received in the second preceding fiscal year by such local educational agency, unless the amount of such revenue was taken into account by the State for such second preceding fiscal year and already resulted in a reduction in the amount of State aid paid to such local educational agency.

#### (b) Basic support payments; insufficient appropriations; State with only one local educational agency
* #### (1) Basic support payments
  * #### (A) In general
    * From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a).

  * #### (B) Eligibility
    * A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of—

      * (ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.

  * #### (C) Maximum amount
    * The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2), multiplied by the greater of—

      * (i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;

      * (ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;

      * (iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994; or

      * (iv) the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located, multiplied by the local contribution percentage.

  * #### (D) Data
    * If satisfactory data from the third preceding fiscal year are not available for any of the expenditures described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall use data from the most recent fiscal year for which data that are satisfactory to the Secretary are available.

  * #### (E) Increase in local contribution rate due to unusual geographic factors
    * If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subparagraph (C) are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency under subparagraph (C)(iii) by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.

    * (F) Beginning with fiscal year 2002, for the purpose of calculating a payment under this paragraph for a local educational agency whose local contribution rate was computed under subparagraph (C)(iii) for the previous year, the Secretary shall use a local contribution rate that is not less than 95 percent of the rate that the LEA received for the preceding year.

* #### (2) Basic support payments for heavily impacted local educational agencies

          * (aa) whose boundaries are the same as a Federal military installation; or

          * (bb)(AA) whose boundaries are the same as an island property designated by the Secretary of the Interior to be property that is held in trust by the Federal Government; and

          * (BB) that has no taxing authority;


        * (II) is a local educational agency that—

        * (II) the average tax rate of all the local educational agencies in the State.

    * #### (ii) Fiscal years 2010–2015
      * #### (I) In general
        * For fiscal years 2010 through 2015, any local educational agency that was found ineligible to receive a payment under subparagraph (A) because the Secretary determined that it failed to meet the average tax rate requirement for general fund purposes in subparagraph (B)(i)(II)(cc), shall be considered to have met that requirement, if its State determined, through an alternate calculation of average tax rates for general fund purposes, that such local educational agency met that requirement.

      * #### (II) Subsequent fiscal years after 2015
        * For any succeeding fiscal year after 2015, any local educational agency identified in subclause (I) may continue to have its State use that alternate methodology to calculate whether the average tax rate requirement for general fund purposes under subparagraph (B)(i)(II)(cc) is met.

      * #### (III) Availability of funds
        * Notwithstanding any other provision of law limiting the period during which the Secretary may obligate funds appropriated for any fiscal year after 2012, the Secretary shall reserve a total of $14,000,000 from funds that remain unobligated under this section from fiscal years 2015 or 2016 in order to make payments under this clause for fiscal years 2011 through 2014.

  * #### (G) Eligibility for heavily impacted local educational agencies affected by privatization of military housing
    * #### (i) Eligibility
      * For any fiscal year, a heavily impacted local educational agency that received a basic support payment under this paragraph for the prior fiscal year, but is ineligible for such payment for the current fiscal year under subparagraph (B) due to the conversion of military housing units to private housing described in clause (iii), or as the direct result of base realignment and closure or modularization as determined by the Secretary of Defense and force structure change or force relocation, shall be deemed to meet the eligibility requirements under subparagraph (B) for the period during which the housing units are undergoing such conversion or during such time as activities associated with base closure and realignment, modularization, force structure change, or force relocation are ongoing.

    * #### (ii) Amount of payment
      * The amount of a payment to a heavily impacted local educational agency for a fiscal year by reason of the application of clause (i), and calculated in accordance with subparagraph (C) or (D), as the case may be, shall be based on the number of children in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency for the fiscal year and under the same provisions of subparagraph (C) or (D) under which the agency was paid during the prior fiscal year.

    * #### (iii) Conversion of military housing units to private housing described

  * #### (B) Learning opportunity threshold payments in lieu of payments under paragraph (1)
    * (i) For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall compute a learning opportunity threshold payment (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the "threshold payment") in lieu of basic support payments under paragraph (1) by multiplying the amount obtained under paragraph (1)(C) by the total percentage obtained by adding—

      * (I) the percentage of federally connected children for each local educational agency determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of children described under subsection (a)(1) and the denominator of which is the total number of children in average daily attendance at the schools served by such agency; and

      * (II) the percentage that funds under paragraph (1)(C) represent of the total budget of the local educational agency, determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of funds calculated for each local educational agency under this paragraph, and the denominator of which is the total current expenditures for such agency in the second preceding fiscal year for which the determination is made.


    * (ii) Such total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 100.

    * (iii) In the case of a local educational agency providing a free public education to students enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12, that enrolls students described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D) of subsection (a)(1) only in grades 9 through 12, and that received a final payment for fiscal year 2009 calculated under section 7703(b)(3) of this title (as such section was in effect on the day before December 10, 2015) for students in grades 9 through 12, the Secretary shall, in calculating the agency's payment, consider only that portion of such agency's total enrollment of students in grades 9 through 12 when calculating the percentage under clause (i)(I) and only that portion of the total current expenditures attributed to the operation of grades 9 through 12 in such agency when calculating the percentage under clause (i)(II).

    * (iv) In the case of a local educational agency that has a total student enrollment of fewer than 1,000 students and that has a per-pupil expenditure that is less than the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the agency is located or less than the average per-pupil expenditure of all the States, the total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under clause (i) shall not be less than 40 percent.

  * #### (C) Learning opportunity threshold payments in lieu of payments under paragraph (2)
    * For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the learning opportunity threshold payment in lieu of basic support payments under paragraph (2) shall be equal to the amount obtained under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (2), as the case may be.

  * #### (D) Ratable distribution
    * For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), for which the sums available exceed the amount required to pay each local educational agency 100 percent of its threshold payment, the Secretary shall distribute the excess sums to each eligible local educational agency that has not received its full amount computed under paragraphs (1) or (2) (as the case may be) by multiplying—

      * (i) a percentage, the denominator of which is the difference between the full amount computed under paragraph (1) or (2) (as the case may be) for all local educational agencies and the amount of the threshold payment (as calculated under subparagraphs (B) and (C)) of all local educational agencies, and the numerator of which is the aggregate of the excess sums, by

      * (ii) the difference between the full amount computed under paragraph (1) or (2) (as the case may be) for the agency and the amount of the threshold payment (as calculated under subparagraphs (B) or (C)) of the agency, except that no local educational agency shall receive more than 100 percent of the maximum payment calculated under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (2).

  * #### (E) Insufficient payments
    * For each fiscal year described in subparagraph (A) for which the sums appropriated are insufficient to pay each local educational agency all of the local educational agency's threshold payment described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall ratably reduce the payment to each local educational agency under this paragraph.

  * #### (F) Increases
    * #### (i) Increases based on insufficient funds
      * If additional funds become available under 7714(b) of this title for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) and those funds are not sufficient to increase each local educational agency's threshold payment above 100 percent of its threshold payment described in subparagraph (B), payments that were reduced under subparagraph (E) shall be increased by the Secretary on the same basis as such payments were reduced.

    * #### (ii) Increases based on sufficient funds
      * If additional funds become available under section 7714(b) of this title for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) and those funds are sufficient to increase each local educational agency's threshold payment above 100 percent of its threshold payment described in subparagraph (B), the payment for each local educational agency shall be 100 percent of its threshold payment. The Secretary shall then distribute the excess sums to each eligible local educational agency in accordance with subparagraph (D).

  * #### (G) Provision of tax rate and resulting percentage
    * As soon as practicable following the payment of funds under paragraph (2) to an eligible local educational agency, the Secretary shall provide the local educational agency with a description of—

      * (i) the tax rate of the local educational agency; and

      * (ii) the percentage such tax rate represents of the average tax rate for general fund purposes of comparable local educational agencies in the State as determined under subclauses (II)(cc), III(aa), or (V)(bb) of paragraph (2)(B)(i) (as the case may be).

* #### (4) States with only one local educational agency
  * #### (A) In general
    * In any of the 50 States of the United States in which there is only one local educational agency, the Secretary shall, for purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1) or subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2), as the case may be, paragraph (3) of this subsection, and subsection (e), consider each administrative school district in the State to be a separate local educational agency.

  * #### (B) Computation of maximum amount of basic support payment and threshold payment
    * In computing the maximum payment amount under paragraph (1)(C) or subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (2), as the case may be, and the learning opportunity threshold payment under subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3), as the case may be, for an administrative school district described in subparagraph (A)—

      * (i) the Secretary shall first determine the maximum payment amount and the total current expenditures for the State as a whole; and

      * (ii) the Secretary shall then—

        * (I) proportionately allocate such maximum payment amount among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective weighted student units of such districts; and

        * (II) proportionately allocate such total current expenditures among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective number of students in average daily attendance at such districts.

* #### (5) Local educational agencies affected by removal of Federal property
  * #### (A) In general
    * In computing the amount of a basic support payment under this subsection for a fiscal year for a local educational agency described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall meet the additional requirements described in subparagraph (C).

      * (i) For each fiscal year beginning after the date on which the Federal property is transferred, a child described in subparagraph (B) who continues to reside on such property and who continues to receive a free public education at a school of the agency shall be deemed to be a child who resides on Federal property for purposes of computing under the applicable subparagraph of subsection (a)(1) the amount that the agency is eligible to receive under this subsection.

      * (ii)(I) For the third fiscal year beginning after the date on which the Federal property is transferred, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the Secretary shall, after computing the amount that the agency is otherwise eligible to receive under this subsection for the fiscal year involved, deduct from such amount an amount equal to the revenue received by the agency for the immediately preceding fiscal year as a result of the taxable status of the former Federal property.

      * (II) For purposes of determining the amount of revenue to be deducted in accordance with subclause (I), the local educational agency—

        * (aa) shall provide for a review and certification of such amount by an appropriate local tax authority; and

        * (bb) shall submit to the Secretary a report containing the amount certified under item (aa).

* #### (3) Exception
