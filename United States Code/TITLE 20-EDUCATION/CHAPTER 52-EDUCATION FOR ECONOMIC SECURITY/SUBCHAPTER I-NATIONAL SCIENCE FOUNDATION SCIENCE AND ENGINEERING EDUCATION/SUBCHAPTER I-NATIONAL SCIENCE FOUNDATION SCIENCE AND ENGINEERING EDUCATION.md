#### (b) Equitable distribution of grants; awards in each State
* In making grants under this section, the Foundation shall assure that there is an equitable distribution among States of institutes established and operated with funds made available under this section. The Foundation shall award not less than one institute in each State, except that the Foundation may waive this requirement if there is no proposal from a State which meets the requirements of this subchapter. Proposals which exceed $300,000 in any fiscal year incorporating the services or resources of more than two entities in the design and operation of the institute, may be funded at the discretion of the Director of the Foundation.

#### (c) Cooperation of advanced technology businesses and other businesses
* Institutes assisted under this subchapter may, to the extent possible, involve the cooperation of advanced technology businesses and other businesses which are able to supply assistance in the teaching of mathematics and science.

#### (d) Requirement of involvement in planning and development
* In making grants under this subchapter, the Foundation shall require assurances that local education agencies will be involved in the planning and development of the institute in the case of applications submitted by other eligible applicants described in subsection (a) of this section, or that one or more such applicants will be involved in the planning and development of the institute in the case of applications submitted by State or local education agencies.

### §3914. Materials development and methods research for mathematics, science, and engineering
#### (a) Authorization to award competitive grants; covered institutions, businesses, etc.; purposes
* The Foundation is authorized, in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, to award competitive grants to institutions of higher education, businesses, nonprofit private organizations, local education agencies, professional engineering and scientific associations, museums, libraries, public broadcasting entities (as defined in section 397(11) of title 47), and appropriate State agencies—

  * (1) for instructional curriculum improvement and faculty development in mathematics, science, and engineering;

  * (2) for programs designed to enhance public understanding of mathematics, science, and engineering, including the use of public broadcasting entities; and

  * (3) for research on methods of instruction and educational programs in mathematics, science, engineering, and critical foreign languages.

#### (b) Scope of studies
* Studies conducted under subsection (a)(3) may include—

  * (1) teaching and learning research and its application to local and private sector instructional materials development and to improved teacher training programs;

  * (2) research on the use of local and informal science education activities;

  * (3) research on recruitment, retention, and improvement of mathematics, science, engineering, and critical languages faculties; and

  * (4) analysis of materials and methods for mathematics, science, and engineering education used in other countries and their potential application in the United States.

#### (c) Matching grant requirements
* Funds awarded for such competitive grants shall be expended through a system requiring matching of the grant. The minimum amount required as a match shall be equal to a percentage of the grant that is determined by the Foundation. Funds made available for matching purposes may include in-kind services or other resources.

#### (d) Materials or methods research application requirements
* In making grant applications for materials or methods research for the purposes described in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3), the Foundation shall assure the involvement of appropriate State or local education agencies in the case of applications submitted by other entities described in subsection (a), or that one or more of such other entities will be consulted in the case of applications submitted by State or local education agencies.

### §3915. Graduate fellowships
