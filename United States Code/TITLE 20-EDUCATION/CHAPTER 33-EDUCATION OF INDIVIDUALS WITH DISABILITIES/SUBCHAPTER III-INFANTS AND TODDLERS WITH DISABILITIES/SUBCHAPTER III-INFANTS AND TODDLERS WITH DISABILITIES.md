### SUBCHAPTER III—INFANTS AND TODDLERS WITH DISABILITIES

### §1431. Findings and policy
#### (a) Findings
* Congress finds that there is an urgent and substantial need—

  * (1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities, to minimize their potential for developmental delay, and to recognize the significant brain development that occurs during a child's first 3 years of life;

  * (2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age;

  * (3) to maximize the potential for individuals with disabilities to live independently in society;

  * (4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities; and

  * (1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system that provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;

  * (2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage);

  * (3) to enhance State capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing early intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families; and

  * (4) to encourage States to expand opportunities for children under 3 years of age who would be at risk of having substantial developmental delay if they did not receive early intervention services.
