### §1078–8. Unsubsidized Stafford loans for middle-income borrowers
#### (a) In general
* It is the purpose of this section to authorize insured loans under this part that are first disbursed before July 1, 2010, for borrowers who do not qualify for Federal interest subsidy payments under section 1078 of this title. Except as provided in this section, all terms and conditions for Federal Stafford loans established under section 1078 of this title shall apply to loans made pursuant to this section.

#### (b) Eligible borrowers
* Prior to July 1, 2010, any student meeting the requirements for student eligibility under section 1091 of this title (including graduate and professional students as defined in regulations promulgated by the Secretary) shall be entitled to borrow an unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan for which the first disbursement is made before such date if the eligible institution at which the student has been accepted for enrollment, or at which the student is in attendance, has—

  * (1) determined and documented the student's need for the loan based on the student's estimated cost of attendance (as determined under section 1087ll of this title) and the student's estimated financial assistance, including a loan which qualifies for interest subsidy payments under section 1078 of this title; and

  * (2) provided the lender a statement—

    * (A) certifying the eligibility of the student to receive a loan under this section and the amount of the loan for which such student is eligible, in accordance with subsection (c); and

    * (B) setting forth a schedule for disbursement of the proceeds of the loan in installments, consistent with the requirements of section 1078–7 of this title.

#### (c) Determination of amount of loan
* The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.

#### (d) Loan limits
* #### (1) In general
  * Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the annual and aggregate limits for loans under this section shall be the same as those established under section 1078(b)(1) of this title, less any amount received by such student pursuant to the subsidized loan program established under section 1078 of this title.

  * #### (B) Aggregate limit

At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that—

    * (A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or
