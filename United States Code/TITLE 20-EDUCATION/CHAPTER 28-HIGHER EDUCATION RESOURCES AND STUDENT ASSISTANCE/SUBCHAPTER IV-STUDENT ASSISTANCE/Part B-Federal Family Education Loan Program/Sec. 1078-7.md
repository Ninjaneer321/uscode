  * (2) may be made directly by the lender or, in the case of a loan under sections 1078 and 1078–1 of this title, may be disbursed pursuant to the escrow provisions of section 1078(i) of this title; and

  * (3) notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), may, with the permission of the borrower, be disbursed by the lender on a weekly or monthly basis, provided that the proceeds of the loan are disbursed by the lender in substantially equal weekly or monthly installments, as the case may be, over the period of enrollment for which the loan is made.

Any portion (or all) of a disbursement installment which is so returned shall be credited to the borrower's loan and treated as a prepayment thereon.

* The provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of a loan made under section 1078–3 of this title, or made to a student to cover the cost of attendance in a program of study abroad approved by the home eligible institution if the home eligible institution has a cohort default rate (as calculated under section 1085(m) of this title) of less than 5 percent.
