### SUBPART 4—LEVERAGING EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM

### §1070c. Purpose; appropriations authorized
#### (a) Purpose of subpart
* It is the purpose of this subpart to make incentive grants available to States to assist States in—

    * (A) eligible students attending institutions of higher education or participating in programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by institutions of higher education at which such students are enrolled; and

    * (B) eligible students for campus-based community service work-study; and


  * (2) carrying out the activities described in section 1070c–3a of this title.

#### (b) Authorization of appropriations; availability
* #### (1) In general
  * There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subpart $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the five succeeding fiscal years.

* #### (2) Reservation
  * For any fiscal year for which the amount appropriated under paragraph (1) exceeds $30,000,000, the excess amount shall be available to carry out section 1070c–3a of this title.

* #### (3) Availability
  * Sums appropriated pursuant to the authority of paragraph (1) for any fiscal year shall remain available for payments to States under this subpart until the end of the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year for which such sums were appropriated.

### §1070c–1. Allotment among States
#### (a) Allotment based on number of eligible students in attendance
* (1) From the sums appropriated pursuant to section 1070c(b)(1) of this title and not reserved under section 1070c(b)(2) of this title for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the number of students who are deemed eligible in such State for participation in the grant program authorized by this subpart bears to the total number of such students in all the States, except that no State shall receive less than the State received for fiscal year 1979.

* (2) For the purpose of this subsection, the number of students who are deemed eligible in a State for participation in the grant program authorized by this subpart, and the number of such students in all the States, shall be determined for the most recent year for which satisfactory data are available.

#### (b) Reallotment
* The amount of any State's allotment under subsection (a) for any fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required for such fiscal year for the leveraging educational assistance partnership program of that State shall be available for reallotment from time to time, on such dates during such year as the Secretary may fix, to other States in proportion to the original allotments to such States under such part for such year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use for such year for carrying out the State plan. The total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount reallotted to a State under this part during a year from funds appropriated pursuant to section 1070c(b)(1) of this title shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (a) for such year.

The application shall contain such information as may be required by, or pursuant to, regulation for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to make the determinations required under this subpart.

#### (b) Payment of Federal share of grants made by qualified program

  * (4) provides for the selection of recipients of such grants or of such State work-study jobs on the basis of substantial financial need determined annually on the basis of criteria established by the State and approved by the Secretary, except that for the purpose of collecting data to make such determination of financial need, no student or parent shall be charged a fee that is payable to an entity other than such State;

  * (5) provides that, effective with respect to any academic year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, all nonprofit institutions of higher education in the State are eligible to participate in the State program, except in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of the constitution of the State or in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of a statute of the State which was enacted prior to October 1, 1978;

  * (6) provides for the payment of the non-Federal portion of such grants or of such work-study jobs from funds supplied by such State which represent an additional expenditure for such year by such State for grants or work-study jobs for students attending institutions of higher education over the amount expended by such State for such grants or work-study jobs, if any, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such State initially received funds under this subpart;

  * (7) provides that if the State's allocation under this subpart is based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students who are independent students or attending the institution less than full time, a reasonable proportion of the State's allocation shall be made available to such students;

  * (8) provides for State expenditures under such program of an amount not less than the average annual aggregate expenditures for the preceding three fiscal years or the average annual expenditure per full-time equivalent student for such years;

  * (9) provides (A) for such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure proper disbursement of and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State agency under this subpart, and (B) for the making of such reports, in such form and containing such information, as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform his functions under this subpart;

    * (A) Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Grants; and

    * (B) funded by the Federal Government, the State, and, where applicable, other contributing partners.

#### (c) Reservation and disbursement of allotments and reallotments
* Upon his approval of any application for a payment under this subpart, the Secretary shall reserve from the applicable allotment (including any applicable reallotment) available therefor, the amount of such payment, which (subject to the limits of such allotment or reallotment) shall be equal to the Federal share of the cost of the students' incentive grants or work-study jobs covered by such application. The Secretary shall pay such reserved amount, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may amend the reservation of any amount under this section, either upon approval of an amendment of the application or upon revision of the estimated cost of the student grants or work-study jobs with respect to which such reservation was made. If the Secretary approves an upward revision of such estimated cost, the Secretary may reserve the Federal share of the added cost only from the applicable allotment (or reallotment) available at the time of such approval.

### §1070c–3. Administration of State programs; judicial review
#### (a) Disapproval of applications; suspension of eligibility
* (1) The Secretary shall not finally disapprove any application for a State program submitted under section 1070c–2 of this title, or any modification thereof, without first affording the State agency submitting the program reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.

* (2) Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency administering a State program approved under this subpart, finds—

  * (A) that the State program has been so changed that it no longer complies with the provisions of this subpart, or

  * (B) that in the administration of the program there is a failure to comply substantially with any such provisions,


* the Secretary shall notify such State agency that the State will not be regarded as eligible to participate in the program under this subpart until he is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply.

#### (b) Review of decisions
* (1) If any State is dissatisfied with the Secretary's final action with respect to the approval of its State program submitted under this subpart or with his final action under subsection (a), such State may appeal to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located. The summons and notice of appeal may be served at any place in the United States. The Commissioner shall forthwith certify and file in the court the transcript of the proceedings and the record on which he based his action.

* (2) The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive; but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify his previous action, and shall certify to the court the transcript and record of further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.

* (3) The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in title 28, section 1254.
