#### (a) Purpose of subpart
* It is the purpose of this subpart to provide, through institutions of higher education, supplemental grants to assist in making available the benefits of postsecondary education to qualified students who demonstrate financial need in accordance with the provisions of part F of this subchapter.

#### (b) Authorization of appropriations
* (1) For the purpose of enabling the Secretary to make payments to institutions of higher education which have made agreements with the Secretary in accordance with section 1070b–2(a) of this title, for use by such institutions for payments to undergraduate students of supplemental grants awarded to them under this subpart, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2009 and each of the five succeeding fiscal years.

* (2) Sums appropriated pursuant to this subsection for any fiscal year shall be available for payments to institutions until the end of the second fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year for which such sums were appropriated.

### §1070b–1. Amount and duration of grants
#### (a) Amount of grant
* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), from the funds received by it for such purpose under this subpart, an institution which awards a supplemental grant to a student for an academic year under this subpart shall, for each year, pay to that student an amount not to exceed the lesser of (A) the amount determined by the institution, in accordance with the provisions of part F of this subchapter, to be needed by that student to enable the student to pursue a course of study at the institution or in a program of study abroad that is approved for credit by the institution at which the student is enrolled, or (B) $4,000.

* (2) If the amount determined under paragraph (1) with respect to a student for any academic year is less than $100, no payment shall be made to that student for that year. For a student enrolled for less than a full academic year, the minimum payment required shall be reduced proportionately.

* (3) For students participating in study abroad programs, the institution shall consider all reasonable costs associated with such study abroad when determining student eligibility. The amount of grant to be awarded in such cases may exceed the maximum amount of $4,000 by as much as $400 if reasonable study abroad costs exceed the cost of attendance at the home institution.

#### (b) Period for receipt of grants; continuing eligibility
* (1) The period during which a student may receive supplemental grants shall be the period required for the completion of the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study being pursued by that student.

* (2) A supplemental grant awarded under this subpart shall entitle the student (to whom it is awarded) to payments pursuant to such grant only if the student meets the requirements of section 1091 of this title, except as provided in section 1070b–2(c) of this title.

#### (c) Distribution of grant during academic year
* Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an institution from making payments of varying amounts from a supplemental grant to a student during an academic year to cover costs for a period which are not applicable to other periods of such academic year.

### §1070b–2. Agreements with institutions; selection of recipients

  * (1) has, in accordance with section 1094 of this title, an agreement with the Secretary applicable to this subpart;

  * (2) agrees that the Federal share of awards under this subpart will not exceed 75 percent of such awards, except that the Federal share may be exceeded if the Secretary determines, pursuant to regulations establishing objective criteria for such determinations, that a larger Federal share is required to further the purpose of this subpart; and

    * (A) institutional grants and scholarships;

    * (B) tuition or fee waivers;

  * (2) makes application at a time and in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Secretary and that institution.

#### (c) Selection of individuals and determination of amount of awards
* (1) From among individuals who are eligible for supplemental grants for each fiscal year, the institution shall, in accordance with the agreement under section 1094 of this title, and within the amount allocated to the institution for that purpose for that year under section 1070b–3 of this title, select individuals who are to be awarded such grants and determine, in accordance with section 1070b–1 of this title, the amounts to be paid to them.

* (2)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1) of this subsection, each institution of higher education shall, in the agreement made under section 1094 of this title, assure that the selection procedures—

  * (i) will be designed to award supplemental grants under this subpart, first, to students with exceptional need, and

  * (ii) will give a priority for supplemental grants under this subpart to students who receive Pell Grants and meet the requirements of section 1091 of this title.


* (B) For the purpose of subparagraph (A), the term "students with exceptional need" means students with the lowest expected family contributions at the institution.

#### (d) Use of funds for less-than-full-time students
* If the institution's allocation under this subpart is directly or indirectly based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students who are independent students or attending the institution on less than a full-time basis, then a reasonable proportion of the allocation shall be made available to such students.

#### (e) Use and transfer of funds for administrative expenses
* An agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall provide that funds granted to an institution of higher education may be used only to make payments to students participating in a grant program authorized under this subpart, except that an institution may use a portion of the sums allocated to it under this subpart to meet administrative expenses in accordance with section 1096 of this title.

### §1070b–3. Allocation of funds
#### (a) Allocation based on previous allocation

* (2)(A) From the amount so appropriated, the Secretary shall next allocate to each eligible institution that began participation in the program under this subpart after fiscal year 1999 but is not a first or second time participant, an amount equal to the greater of—

  * (i) $5,000; or

  * (ii) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this subpart for the first year it participated in the program.


* (B) From the amount so appropriated, the Secretary shall next allocate to each eligible institution that began participation in the program under this subpart after fiscal year 1999 and is a first or second time participant, an amount equal to the greatest of—

  * (i) $5,000;

  * (ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this subpart in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or

  * (iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.


* (C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which—

  * (i) was a first-time participant in the program in fiscal year 2000 or any subsequent fiscal year, and

  * (ii) received a larger amount under this subsection in the second year of participation,


* an amount equal to 90 percent of the amount it received under this subsection in its second year of participation.

* (3)(A) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) of this subsection, then the amount of the allocation to each such institution shall be ratably reduced.

* (B) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is more than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) but less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (2), then—

  * (ii) the amount of the allocation to each institution under paragraph (2) shall be ratably reduced.

* (4)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may allocate an amount equal to not more than 10 percent of the amount by which the amount appropriated in any fiscal year to carry out this part exceeds $700,000,000 among eligible institutions described in subparagraph (B).

* (B) In order to receive an allocation pursuant to subparagraph (A) an institution shall be an eligible institution from which 50 percent or more of the Pell Grant recipients attending such eligible institution graduate from or transfer to a 4-year institution of higher education.

#### (b) Allocation of excess based on fair share
* (1) From the remainder of the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1070b(b) of this title for each year (after making the allocations required by subsection (a)), the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which has an excess eligible amount an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as such excess eligible amount bears to the sum of the excess eligible amounts of all such eligible institutions (having such excess eligible amounts).

* (2) For any eligible institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which—

  * (A)(i) the amount of that institution's need (as determined under subsection (c)), divided by (ii) the sum of the need of all institutions (as so determined), multiplied by (iii) the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1070b(b) of this title of the fiscal year; exceeds

  * (B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (a).

#### (c) Determination of institution's need
* (1) The amount of an institution's need is equal to—

  * (A) the sum of the need of the institution's eligible undergraduate students; minus

  * (B) the sum of grant aid received by students under subparts 1 and 3 of this part.


* (2) To determine the need of an institution's eligible undergraduate students, the Secretary shall—

  * (A) establish various income categories for dependent and independent undergraduate students;

  * (B) establish an expected family contribution for each income category of dependent and independent undergraduate students, determined on the basis of the average expected family contribution (computed in accordance with part F of this subchapter) of a representative sample within each income category for the second preceding fiscal year;

  * (C) compute 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students;

  * (D) multiply the number of eligible dependent students in each income category by 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C), minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;

  * (E) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) for each income category of dependent students;

  * (F) multiply the number of eligible independent students in each income category by 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C), minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;

  * (G) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (F) for each income category of independent students; and

  * (H) add the amounts determined under subparagraphs (E) and (G).


* (3)(A) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term "average cost of attendance" means the average of the attendance costs for undergraduate students, which shall include (i) tuition and fees determined in accordance with subparagraph (B), (ii) standard living expenses determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), and (iii) books and supplies determined in accordance with subparagraph (D).

* (B) The average undergraduate tuition and fees described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be computed on the basis of information reported by the institution to the Secretary, which shall include (i) total revenue received by the institution from undergraduate tuition and fees for the second year preceding the year for which it is applying for an allocation, and (ii) the institution's enrollment for such second preceding year.

* (C) The standard living expense described in subparagraph (A)(ii) is equal to 150 percent of the difference between the income protection allowance for a family of five with one in college and the income protection allowance for a family of six with one in college for a single independent student.

* (D) The allowance for books and supplies described in subparagraph (A)(iii) is equal to $600.

#### (d) Reallocation of excess allocations

* (2) If under paragraph (1) of this subsection an institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation, the institution's allocation for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount returned. The Secretary may waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that enforcing this paragraph would be contrary to the interest of the program.

#### (e) Filing deadlines
* The Secretary shall, from time to time, set dates before which institutions must file applications for allocations under this part.
