    * (E) has necessary research resources not otherwise readily available in such institutions to such students.

#### (b) Award and duration of grants
* #### (1) Awards
  * The principal criterion for the award of grants shall be the relative quality of the graduate programs presented in competing applications. Consistent with an allocation of awards based on quality of competing applications, the Secretary shall, in awarding such grants, promote an equitable geographic distribution among eligible public and private institutions of higher education.

* #### (2) Duration and amount
  * #### (A) Duration
    * The Secretary shall award a grant under this subpart for a period of 3 years.

* #### (3) Reallotment
  * Whenever the Secretary determines that an academic department, program or unit of an institution of higher education is unable to use all of the amounts available to the department, program or unit under this subpart, the Secretary shall, on such dates during each fiscal year as the Secretary may fix, reallot the amounts not needed to academic departments, programs and units of institutions which can use the grants authorized by this subpart.

#### (c) Preference to continuing grant recipients
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall make new grant awards under this subpart only to the extent that each previous grant recipient under this subpart has received continued funding in accordance with subsection (b)(2)(A).

* #### (2) Ratable reduction
  * To the extent that appropriations under this subpart are insufficient to comply with paragraph (1), available funds shall be distributed by ratably reducing the amounts required to be awarded under subsection (b)(2)(A).

### §1135a. Institutional eligibility
#### (a) Eligibility criteria
* Any academic department, program or unit of an institution of higher education that offers a program of postbaccalaureate study leading to a graduate degree, including a master's or doctoral degree, in an area of national need (as designated under subsection (b)) may apply for a grant under this subpart. No department, program or unit shall be eligible for a grant unless the program of postbaccalaureate study has been in existence for at least 4 years at the time of application for assistance under this subpart.

#### (b) Designation of areas of national need
* After consultation with appropriate Federal and nonprofit agencies and organizations, including the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Secretary shall designate areas of national need. In making such designations, the Secretary shall take into consideration—

  * (1) the extent to which the interest in the area is compelling;

  * (2) the extent to which other Federal programs support postbaccalaureate study in the area concerned;

  * (3) an assessment of how the program may achieve the most significant impact with available resources; and

  * (4) an assessment of current (as of the time of the designation) and future professional workforce needs of the United States.

### §1135b. Criteria for applications
#### (a) Selection of applications
* The Secretary shall make grants to academic departments, programs and units of institutions of higher education on the basis of applications submitted in accordance with subsection (b). Applications shall be ranked on program quality by review panels of nationally recognized scholars and evaluated on the quality and effectiveness of the academic program and the achievement and promise of the students to be served. To the extent possible (consistent with other provisions of this section), the Secretary shall make awards that are consistent with recommendations of the review panels.

#### (b) Contents of applications
* An academic department, program or unit of an institution of higher education, in the department, program or unit's application for a grant, shall—

  * (1) describe the current academic program of the applicant for which the grant is sought;

  * (2) provide assurances that the applicant will provide, from other non-Federal sources, for the purposes of the fellowship program under this subpart an amount equal to at least 25 percent of the amount of the grant received under this subpart, which contribution may be in cash or in kind, fairly valued;

  * (3) set forth policies and procedures to assure that, in making fellowship awards under this subpart, the institution will seek talented students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds, as determined by the Secretary;

### §1135c. Awards to graduate students
#### (a) Commitments to graduate students
* #### (1) In general
  * An academic department, program or unit of an institution of higher education shall make commitments to graduate students who are eligible students under section 1091 of this title (including students pursuing a doctoral degree after having completed a master's degree program at an institution of higher education) at any point in their graduate study to provide stipends for the length of time necessary for a student to complete the course of graduate study, but in no case longer than 5 years.

* #### (2) Special rule
  * No such commitments shall be made to students under this subpart unless the academic department, program or unit has determined adequate funds are available to fulfill the commitment from funds received or anticipated under this subpart, or from institutional funds.

#### (b) Amount of stipends
* The Secretary shall make payments to institutions of higher education for the purpose of paying stipends to individuals who are awarded fellowships under this subpart. The stipends the Secretary establishes shall reflect the purpose of the program under this subpart to encourage highly talented students to undertake graduate study as described in this subpart. In the case of an individual who receives such individual's first stipend under this subpart in academic year 2009–2010 or any succeeding academic year, such stipend shall be set at a level of support equal to that provided by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program for such academic year, except such amount shall be adjusted as necessary so as not to exceed the fellow's demonstrated level of need as determined under part F of subchapter IV.

#### (c) Treatment of institutional payments
* An institution of higher education that makes institutional payments for tuition and fees on behalf of individuals supported by fellowships under this subpart in amounts that exceed the institutional payments made by the Secretary pursuant to section 1135d(a) of this title may count such excess toward the amounts the institution is required to provide pursuant to section 1135b(b)(2) of this title.

#### (d) Academic progress required
* Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), no student shall receive an award—

  * (1) except during periods in which such student is maintaining satisfactory progress in, and devoting essentially full time to, study or research in the field in which such fellowship was awarded; or

  * (2) if the student is engaging in gainful employment other than part-time employment involved in teaching, research, or similar activities determined by the institution to be in support of the student's progress towards a degree.

### §1135d. Additional assistance for cost of education
#### (a) Institutional payments
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall (in addition to stipends paid to individuals under this subpart) pay to the institution of higher education, for each individual awarded a fellowship under this subpart at such institution, an institutional allowance. Except as provided in paragraph (2), such allowance shall be, for 2009–2010 and succeeding academic years, the same amount as the institutional payment made for 2008–2009 adjusted annually thereafter in accordance with inflation as determined by the Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for the previous calendar year.

* #### (2) Reduction
  * The institutional allowance paid under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the amount the institution charges and collects from a fellowship recipient for tuition and other expenses as part of the recipient's instructional program.

#### (b) Use for overhead prohibited
* Funds made available pursuant to this subpart may not be used for the general operational overhead of the academic department or program.

### §1135e. Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and each of the five succeeding fiscal years to carry out this subpart.
