#### (a) Authority and timing of awards
* The Secretary is authorized to award fellowships in accordance with the provisions of this subpart for graduate study in the arts, humanities, and social sciences by students of superior ability selected on the basis of demonstrated achievement, financial need, and exceptional promise.

All funds appropriated in a fiscal year shall be obligated and expended to the students for fellowships for use in the academic year beginning after July 1 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated. The fellowships shall be awarded for only 1 academic year of study and shall be renewable for a period not to exceed 4 years of study.

In the case of other exceptional circumstances, such as active duty military service or personal or family member illness, the institution of higher education may also permit the fellowship recipient to interrupt periods of study for the duration of the tour of duty (in the case of military service) or for not more than 12 months (in any other case), but without payment of the stipend.
