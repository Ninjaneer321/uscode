### SUBPART 1—MINORITY SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM

### §1067. Findings
* Congress makes the following findings:

  * (1) It is incumbent on the Federal Government to support the technological and economic competitiveness of the United States by improving and expanding the scientific and technological capacity of the United States. More and better prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts are needed to improve and expand such capacity.

  * (2) As the Nation's population becomes more diverse, it is important that the educational and training needs of all Americans are met. Underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields diminishes our Nation's competitiveness by impairing the quantity of well prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts in these fields.

  * (3) Despite significant limitations in resources, minority institutions provide an important educational opportunity for minority students, particularly in science and engineering fields. Aid to minority institutions is a good way to address the underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields.

  * (4) There is a strong Federal interest in improving science and engineering programs at minority institutions as such programs lag behind in program offerings and in student enrollment compared to such programs at other institutions of higher education.

### §1067a. Purpose; authority
#### (a) Congressional declaration of purpose
* It is the purpose of this subpart to continue the authority of the Department to operate the Minority Institutions Science Improvement Program created under section 1862(a)(1) of title 42 and transferred to the Department by section 3444(a)(1) of this title.

#### (b) Grant authority
* The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, carry out a program of making grants to institutions of higher education that are designed to effect long-range improvement in science and engineering education at predominantly minority institutions and to increase the participation of underrepresented ethnic minorities, particularly minority women, in scientific and technological careers.

### §1067b. Grant recipient selection
#### (a) Establishment of criteria
* Grants under this subpart shall be awarded on the basis of criteria established by the Secretary by regulations.

#### (b) Priorities to be given in criteria
* In establishing criteria under subsection (a), the Secretary shall give priority to applicants which have not previously received funding from the Minority Institutions Science Improvement Program and to previous grantees with a proven record of success, as well as to applications that contribute to achieving balance among projects with respect to geographic region, academic discipline, and project type.

#### (c) Required criteria
* In establishing criteria under subsection (a), the Secretary may consider the following selection criteria in making grants:

  * (1) plan of operation;

  * (2) quality of key personnel;

  * (3) budget and cost effectiveness;

  * (4) evaluation plan;

  * (5) adequacy of resources;

  * (6) identification of need for the project;

  * (7) potential institutional impact of the project;

  * (8) institutional commitment to the project;

  * (9) expected outcomes; and

  * (10) scientific and educational value of the proposed project.

### §1067c. Use of funds
#### (a) Types of grants
* Funds appropriated to carry out this subpart may be made available as—

  * (1) institutional grants (as defined in section 1067k(6) of this title);

  * (2) cooperative grants (as defined in section 1067k(7) of this title);

  * (3) design projects (as defined in section 1067k(8) of this title); or

  * (4) special projects (as defined in section 1067k(9) of this title).

#### (b) Authorized uses for each type of grant
* (1) The authorized uses of funds made available as institutional grants include (but are not limited to)—

  * (A) faculty development programs; or

  * (B) development of curriculum materials.


* (2) The authorized uses of funds made available as cooperative grants include (but are not limited to)—

  * (A) assisting institutions in sharing facilities and personnel;

  * (B) disseminating information about established programs in science and engineering;

  * (C) supporting cooperative efforts to strengthen the institutions' science and engineering programs; or

  * (D) carrying out a combination of any of the activities in subparagraphs (A) through (C).


* (3) The authorized uses of funds made available as design projects include (but are not limited to)—

  * (A) developing planning, management, and evaluation systems; or

  * (B) developing plans for initiating scientific research and for improving institutions' capabilities for such activities.


* Funds used for design project grants may not be used to pay more than 50 percent of the salaries during any academic year of faculty members involved in the project.

* (4) The authorized uses of funds made available as special projects include (but are not limited to)—

  * (A) advanced science seminars;

  * (B) science faculty workshops and conferences;

  * (C) faculty training to develop specific science research or education skills;

  * (D) research in science education;

  * (E) programs for visiting scientists;

  * (F) preparation of films or audio-visual materials in science;

  * (G) development of learning experiences in science beyond those normally available to minority undergraduate students;

  * (H) development of pre-college enrichment activities in science; or

  * (I) any other activities designed to address specific barriers to the entry of minorities into science.
