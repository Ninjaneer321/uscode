* (2)(A) An institution shall invest the endowment fund corpus and endowment fund income in low-risk securities in which a regulated insurance company may invest under the law of the State in which the institution is located such as a federally insured bank savings account or comparable interest-bearing account, certificate of deposit, money market fund, mutual fund, or obligations of the United States.

* (B) The institution, in investing the endowment fund established under this section, shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which a person of prudence, discretion, and intelligence would exercise in the management of such person's own affairs.

* (2) If an institution expends more of the endowment fund income than is permitted under subsection (c), the institution shall repay the Secretary an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount improperly expended (representing the Federal share thereof). The Secretary may use such repaid fund to make additional challenge grants, or to increase existing challenge grants, to other eligible institutions.

#### (e) Audit information
