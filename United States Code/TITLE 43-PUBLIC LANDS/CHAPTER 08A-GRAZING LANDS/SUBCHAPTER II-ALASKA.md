No such alteration shall be made until after public hearings are held with respect to such alteration in each such judicial division after the publishing of such notice.

### §316e. Preferences

#### (b) Size of leasehold
* Leases shall be made for grazing on a definite area except where local conditions or the administration of grazing privileges makes more practicable a lease based on the number of stock to be grazed.

#### (c) Terms for surrender of lease
* Each lease shall provide that the lessee may surrender his lease, and, if he has complied with the terms and conditions of the lease to the time of surrender, may avoid further liability for fees thereunder by giving written notice to the Secretary of such surrender.

  * (3) Be fixed with due regard to the general economic value of the grazing privileges, and in no case shall exceed such value; and

  * (4) Be moderate.


* (b) If the Secretary determines such action to be for the public interest by reason of (1) depletion or destruction of the range by any cause beyond the control of the lessee, or (2) calamity or disease causing wholesale destruction of or injury to livestock, he may grant an extension of time for making payment of any grazing fee undue any lease, reduce the amount of any such payment, or release or discharge the lessee from making such payment.

### §316h. Dispositions of receipts
* All moneys received during any fiscal year on account of such fees in excess of the actual cost of administration of this subchapter shall be paid at the end thereof by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Territory of Alaska, to be expended in such manner as the Legislature of the Territory may direct for the benefit of public education and roads.
