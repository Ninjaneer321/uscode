### SUBCHAPTER XI–A—RECLAMATION SAFETY OF DAMS

### §506. Authority of Secretary to make modifications
* In order to preserve the structural safety of Bureau of Reclamation dams and related facilities the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to perform such modifications as he determines to be reasonably required. Said performance of work shall be in accordance with the Federal reclamation laws (Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, and Acts amendatory or supplementary thereto).

### §507. Construction for dam safety
* Except as provided in section 509b of this title, construction authorized by this subchapter shall be for the purposes of dam safety and not for the specific purposes of providing additional conservation storage capacity or of developing benefits over and above those provided by the original dams and reservoirs. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to reduce the amount of project costs allocated to reimbursable purposes heretofore authorized.

### §508. Costs incurred in the modification of structures
#### (a) Costs resulting from age and normal deterioration or lack of maintenance of structures
* Costs heretofore or hereafter incurred in the modification of structures under this subchapter, the cause of which results from age and normal deterioration of the structure or from nonperformance of reasonable and normal maintenance of the structure by the operating entity shall be considered as project costs and will be allocated to the purposes for which the structure was authorized initially to be constructed and will be reimbursable as provided by existing law.

#### (b) Nonreimbursable costs resulting from new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in criteria
* With respect to the $100,000,000 authorized to be appropriated in the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 [43 U.S.C. 509], costs heretofore or hereafter incurred in the modification of structures under this subchapter, the cause of which results from new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in state-of-the-art criteria deemed necessary for safety purposes shall be nonreimbursable and nonreturnable under the Federal Reclamation law.

#### (c) Reimbursement of certain modification costs
* With respect to the additional amounts authorized to be appropriated by section 509 of this title, costs incurred in the modification of structures under this subchapter, the cause of which results from new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in state-of-the-art criteria deemed necessary for safety purposes, shall be reimbursed to the extent provided in this subsection.

  * (1) Fifteen percent of such costs shall be allocated to the authorized purposes of the structure, except that in the case of Jackson Lake Dam, Minidoka Project, Idaho-Wyoming, such costs shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation of operation and maintenance charges.

  * (2) Costs allocated to irrigation water service and capable of being repaid by the irrigation water users shall be reimbursed within 50 years of the year in which the work undertaken pursuant to this subchapter is substantially complete. Costs allocated to irrigation water service which are beyond the water users' ability to pay shall be reimbursed in accordance with existing law.

  * (3) Costs allocated to recreation or fish and wildlife enhancement shall be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Water Project Recreation Act (79 Stat. 213), as amended [16 U.S.C. 460l–12 et seq.].

  * (4) Costs allocated to the purpose of municipal, industrial, and miscellaneous water service, commercial power, and the portion of recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement costs reimbursable under the Federal Water Project Recreation Act [16 U.S.C. 460l–12 et seq.], shall be repaid within 50 years with interest. The interest rate used shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the applicable reimbursement period during the month preceding the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred. To the extent that more than one interest rate is determined pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an interest rate at the weighted average of the rates so determined.

#### (d) Contracts for return of costs
* The Secretary is authorized to negotiate appropriate contracts with project beneficiaries providing for the return of reimbursable costs under this subchapter: _Provided, however_, That no contract entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall be deemed to be a new or amended contract for the purposes of section 390cc(a) of this title.

#### (e) Cost containment; modification status
* (1) During the construction of the modification, the Secretary shall consider cost containment measures recommended by a project beneficiary that has elected to consult with the Bureau of Reclamation on a modification.

* (2) The Secretary shall provide to project beneficiaries on a periodic basis notice regarding the costs and status of the modification.

### §509. Authorization of appropriations; report to Congress
* There are hereby authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1979 and ensuing fiscal years such sums as may be necessary and, effective October 1, 1983, not to exceed an additional $650,000,000 (October 1, 1983, price levels), and, effective October 1, 2000, not to exceed an additional $95,000,000 (October 1, 2000, price levels), and, effective October 1, 2001, not to exceed an additional $32,000,000 (October 1, 2001, price levels), and, effective October 1, 2003, not to exceed an additional $540,000,000 (October 1, 2003, price levels), and effective October 1, 2015, not to exceed an additional $1,100,000,000 (October 1, 2003, price levels), plus or minus such amounts, if any, as may be justified by reason of ordinary fluctuations in construction costs as indicated by engineering cost indexes applicable to the types of construction involved herein, to carry out the provisions of this subchapter to remain available until expended if so provided by the appropriations Act: _Provided_, That no funds exceeding $20,000,000 (October 1, 2003, price levels), as adjusted to reflect any ordinary fluctuations in construction costs indicated by applicable engineering cost indexes, shall be obligated for carrying out actual construction to modify an existing dam under authority of this subchapter prior to 30 calendar days from the date that the Secretary has transmitted a report on such existing dam to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate. The report required to be submitted by this section will consist of a finding by the Secretary of the Interior to the effect that modifications are required to be made to insure the safety of an existing dam. Such finding shall be accompanied by a technical report containing information on the need for structural modification, the corrective action deemed to be required, alternative solutions to structural modification that were considered, the estimated cost of needed modifications, and environmental impacts if any resulting from the implementation of the recommended plan of modification. For modification expenditures between $1,800,000 and $20,000,000 (October 1, 2015, price levels), the Secretary of the Interior shall, at least 30 days before the date on which the funds are expended, submit written notice of the expenditures to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate that provides a summary of the project, the cost of the project, and any alternatives that were considered.

### §509a. Project beneficiaries
#### (a) Notice of modification
* On identifying a Bureau of Reclamation facility for modification, the Secretary shall provide to the project beneficiaries written notice—

  * (1) describing the need for the modification and the process for identifying and implementing the modification; and

  * (2) summarizing the administrative and legal requirements relating to the modification.

#### (b) Consultation
* The Secretary shall—

  * (1) provide project beneficiaries an opportunity to consult with the Bureau of Reclamation on the planning, design, and construction of the proposed modification; and

  * (2) in consultation with project beneficiaries, develop and provide timeframes for the consultation described in paragraph (1).

#### (c) Alternatives
* (1) Prior to submitting the reports required under section 509 of this title, the Secretary shall consider any alternative submitted in writing, in accordance with the timeframes established under subsection (b), by a project beneficiary that has elected to consult with the Bureau of Reclamation on a modification.

* (2) The Secretary shall provide to the project beneficiary a timely written response describing proposed actions, if any, to address the recommendation.

* (3) The response of the Secretary shall be included in the reports required by section 509 of this title.

#### (d) Waiver
* The Secretary may waive 1 or more of the requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (c), if the Secretary determines that implementation of the requirement could have an adverse impact on dam safety or security.

### §509b. Additional project benefits through the construction of new or supplementary works
* Notwithstanding section 507 of this title, if the Secretary, in her judgment, determines that additional project benefits, including but not limited to additional conservation storage capacity, are necessary and in the interests of the United States and the project and are feasible and not inconsistent with the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary is authorized to develop additional project benefits through the construction of new or supplementary works on a project in conjunction with the Secretary's activities under section 506 of this title and subject to the conditions described in the feasibility study, provided a cost share agreement related to the additional project benefits is reached among non-Federal and Federal funding participants and the costs associated with developing the additional project benefits are allocated exclusively among beneficiaries of the additional project benefits and repaid consistent with all provisions of Federal Reclamation law (the Act of June 17, 1902, 43 U.S.C. 371 et seq.) and acts supplemental to and amendatory of that Act.
