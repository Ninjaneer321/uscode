### SUBCHAPTER IX—CONSTRUCTION CHARGES

### §461. Determination of construction charges generally
* The construction charges which shall be made per acre upon the entries and upon lands in private ownership which may be irrigated by the waters of any irrigation project shall be determined with a view of returning to the reclamation fund the estimated cost of construction of the project, and shall be apportioned equitably.

### §462. Classification of irrigable lands and equitable apportionment of charges
* The irrigable lands of each new project and new division of a project approved, after December 5, 1924, shall be classified by the Secretary with respect to their power, under a proper agricultural program, to support a family and pay water charges, and the Secretary is authorized to fix different construction charges against different classes of land under the same project for the purpose of equitably apportioning the total construction cost so that all lands may as far as practicable bear the burden of such cost according to their productive value.

### §464. Increases of charges on failure to make water-right application
* In all cases where application for water right for lands in private ownership or lands held under entries not subject to the reclamation law shall not be made within one year after August 13, 1914, or within one year after notice issued in pursuance of section 419 of this title, in cases where such notice has not been issued prior to August 13, 1914, the construction charges for such land shall be increased 5 per centum each year until such application is made and an initial installment is paid.

### §465. Charges for water service prior to notice of construction charge
* Whenever water is available and it is impracticable to apportion operation and maintenance charges as provided in section 492 of this title, the Secretary of the Interior may, prior to giving public notice of the construction charge per acre upon land under any project, furnish water to any entryman or private landowner thereunder until such notice is given, making a reasonable charge therefor, and such charges shall be subject to the same penalties and to the provisions for cancellation and collection as herein provided for other operation and maintenance charges.

### §466. Surveys to correct errors or inequalities in original basis of project
* On each project existing prior to December 5, 1924, where, in the opinion of the Secretary, it appears that on account of lack of fertility in the soil, an inadequate water supply, or other physical causes, settlers are unable to pay construction costs, or whenever it appears that the cost of any reclamation project by reason of error or mistake or for any cause has been apportioned or charged upon a smaller area of land than the total area of land under said project, the Secretary is authorized to undertake a comprehensive and detailed survey to ascertain all pertinent facts, and report in each case the result of such survey to the Congress, with his recommendations: _Provided_, That the cost and expense of each such survey shall be charged to the appropriation for the project on account of which the same is made, but shall not be charged as a part of the construction or operation and maintenance cost payable by the water users under the project.

### §468. Withdrawal of notice given and modification of applications and contracts made prior to February 13, 1911
* The Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, withdraw any public notice issued prior to February 13, 1911, under section 419 of this title, and he may agree to such modification of water-right applications duly filed prior to February 13, 1911, or contracts with water users' associations and others, entered into prior to February 13, 1911, as he may deem advisable, or he may consent to the abrogation of such water-right applications and contracts, and proceed in all respects as if no such notice has been given.

### §469. Increase in construction charges
* No increase in the construction charges shall, after August 13, 1914, be made, after the same have been fixed by public notice, except by agreement between the Secretary of the Interior and a majority of the water-right applicants and entrymen to be affected by such increase, whereupon all water-right applicants and entrymen in the area proposed to be affected by the increased charge shall become subject thereto. Such increased charge shall be added to the construction charge and payment thereof distributed over the remaining unpaid installments of construction charges: _Provided_, That the Secretary of the Interior, in his discretion, may agree that such increased construction charge shall be paid in additional annual installments, each of which shall be at least equal to the amount of the largest installment as fixed for the project by the public notice theretofore issued. And such additional installments of the increased construction charge, as so agreed upon shall become due and payable on December 1 of each year subsequent to the year when the final installment of the construction charge under such public notice is due and payable: _Provided further_, That all such increased construction charges shall be subject to the same conditions, penalties, and suit or action as provided in sections 478, 480, and 481 of this title.

### §470. When work increasing construction charge may be undertaken
* No work shall be undertaken or expenditure made for any lands, for which the construction charge has been fixed by public notice, which work or expenditure shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior, increase the construction cost above the construction charge so fixed; unless and until valid and binding agreement to repay the cost thereof shall have been entered into between the Secretary of the Interior and the water-right applicants and entrymen affected by such increased cost, as provided by section 469 of this title.

### §471. Initial payment and annual installments of charges generally
* Any entryman or applicant shall at the time of making water-right application or entry, as the case may be, pay into the reclamation fund 5 per centum of the construction charge fixed for his land as an initial installment, and shall pay the balance of said charge in annual installments. The first of the annual installments shall become due and payable on December 1 of the fifth calendar year after the initial installment: _Provided_, That any water-right applicant or entryman may, if he so elects, pay the whole or any part of the construction charges owing by him within any shorter period: _Provided further_, That entry may be made whenever water is available, as announced by the Secretary of the Interior, and the initial payment be made when the charge per acre is established.

### §472. Installments on entries or applications made after August 13, 1914, and prior to December 5, 1924
* Any person whose lands, after August 13, 1914, and prior to December 5, 1924, became subject to the terms and conditions of the Act approved June seventeenth, nineteen hundred and two, entitled "An Act appropriating the receipts from the sale and disposal of public lands in certain States and Territories to the construction of irrigation works for the reclamation of arid lands," and Acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, hereafter to be referred to as the reclamation law, and any person who, after August 13, 1914, and prior to December 5, 1924, made entry thereunder shall pay the balance of said charge after the initial payment in fifteen annual installments, the first five of which shall each be five per centum of the construction charge and the remainder shall each be seven per centum until the whole amount shall have been paid.

### §475. Annual installments on entries and contracts prior to August 13, 1914
* Any person whose land or entry, prior to August 13, 1914, became subject to the terms and conditions of the reclamation law shall pay the construction charge, or the portion of the construction charge remaining unpaid, in twenty annual installments, the first of which shall become due and payable on December 1 of the year in which the public notice affecting his land is issued, and subsequent installments on December 1 of each year thereafter. The first four of such installments shall each be 2 per centum, the next two installments shall each be 4 per centum, and the next fourteen each 6 per centum of the total construction charge, or the portion of the construction charge unpaid at the beginning of such installments.

* Any person whose land or entry prior to August 13, 1914, became subject to the reclamation law, who desires to secure the benefits of the extension of the period of payments provided by sections 373, 414, 418, 435 to 437, 440, 443, 464, 465, 469, 471, 472, 475, 477 to 481, 492, 493, 494 to 497 and 499 of this title, shall, within six months after the issuance of the first public notice hereunder affecting his land or entry, notify the Secretary of the Interior, in the manner to be prescribed by said Secretary, of his acceptance of all the terms and conditions of such sections, and thereafter his lands or entry shall be subject to all of the provisions of such sections: _Provided_, That upon sufficient showing the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, permit notice of acceptance of all the terms and conditions of such sections to be filed at any time after the time limit hereinbefore fixed for filing such acceptance shall have expired, conditioned, however, that where the applicant for such acceptance is in arrears on construction charges, he shall at the time of acceptance pay such installments of the construction charge as he would have been required to pay had he accepted the benefits of such sections within the time limit hereinabove fixed, plus the penalties that would have accrued had he so accepted, and such applicant shall thereafter be upon the same status that he would have been had he accepted the provisions of such sections within the time limit hereinabove fixed, and thereafter the lands or entry of any such persons so filing such notice of acceptance shall be subject to all the provisions of such sections.

### §477. Association or irrigation district as fiscal agent of Government
* The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in his discretion, to designate and appoint, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, the legally organized water-users' association or irrigation district, under any reclamation project, as the fiscal agent of the United States to collect the annual payments on the construction charge of the project and the annual charges for operation and maintenance and all penalties: _Provided_, That no water-right applicant or entryman shall be entitled to credit for any payment thus made until the same shall have been paid over to an officer designated by the Secretary of the Interior to receive the same.

### §478. Pecuniary penalty for nonpayment of installments of construction charges
* If any water-right applicant or entryman shall have, prior to December 5, 1924, failed to pay any installment of his construction charges when due, there shall be added to the amount unpaid a penalty of 1 per centum thereof, and there shall be added a like penalty of 1 per centum of the amount unpaid on the first day of each month thereafter so long as such default shall have continued: _Provided_, That the penalty of 1 per centum per month against delinquent accounts, is reduced to one-half of 1 per centum per month, as to all installments which may become due after December 5, 1924.

### §481. Action to recover construction charges and penalties
* If the Secretary of the Interior shall so elect, he may cause suit or action to be brought for the recovery of the amount of the construction charges in default and penalties; but if suit or action be brought, the right to declare a cancellation and forfeiture of the entry or water-right application as provided in section 480 of this title shall be suspended pending such suit or action.
