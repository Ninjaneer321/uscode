### §505. Sale of duplicate plates

### §506. Time for printing documents or reports which include illustrations or maps

### §507. Orders for printing to be acted upon within one year
* An order for public printing may not be acted upon by the Director of the Government Publishing Office after the expiration of one year unless the entire copy and illustrations for the work have been furnished within that period.

### §508. Annual estimates of quantity of paper required for public printing and binding
* At the beginning of each session of Congress, the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall submit to the Joint Committee on Printing estimates of the quantity of paper of all descriptions required for the public printing and binding during the ensuing year.

### §509. Standards of paper; advertisements for proposals; samples
* The Joint Committee on Printing shall fix upon standards of paper for the different descriptions of public printing and binding, and the Director of the Government Publishing Office, under their direction, shall advertise in six newspapers or trade journals, published in different cities, for sealed proposals to furnish the Government with paper, as specified in the schedule to be furnished applicants by the Director of the Government Publishing Office, setting forth in detail the quality and quantities required for the public printing. The Director of the Government Publishing Office shall furnish samples of the standard of papers fixed upon to applicants who desire to bid.

### §510. Specifications in advertisements for paper
* The advertisements for proposals shall specify the minimum portion of each quality of paper required for either three months, six months, or one year, as the Joint Committee on Printing determines; but when the minimum portion so specified exceeds, in any case, one thousand reams, it shall state that proposals will be received for one thousand reams or more.

### §511. Opening bids; bonds
* The sealed proposals to furnish paper and envelopes shall be opened in the presence of the Joint Committee on Printing who shall award the contracts to the lowest and best bidder for the interest of the Government. The committee may not consider a proposal that is not accompanied by a bond with security or certified check in the amount of $5,000, guaranteeing that the bidder if his proposal is accepted, will enter into a formal contract with the United States to furnish the paper or envelopes specified. The Committee may not consider a proposal from a person unknown to it unless accompanied by satisfactory evidence that he is a manufacturer of or dealer in the description of paper or envelopes proposed to be furnished.

### §512. Approval of paper contracts; time for performance; bonds
* A contract for furnishing paper is not valid until approved by the Joint Committee on Printing. The award of a contract for furnishing paper shall designate a reasonable time for its performance. The contractor shall give bond in an amount fixed and approved by the Committee.

### §513. Comparison of paper and envelopes with standard quality
* The Director of the Government Publishing Office shall compare every lot of paper and envelopes delivered by a contractor with the standard of quality fixed upon by the Joint Committee on Printing, and may not accept paper or envelopes which do not conform to it in every particular. A lot of delivered paper or envelopes which does not conform to the standard of quality may be accepted by the Committee at a discount that in its opinion is sufficient to protect the interests of the Government.

### §514. Determination of quality of paper

### §515. Default of contractor; new contracts and purchase in open market
* If a contractor fails to comply with his contract, the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall report the default to the Joint Committee on Printing, and under its direction, enter into a new contract with the lowest, best, and most responsible bidder for the interest of the Government among those whose proposals were rejected at the last opening of bids, or he shall advertise for new proposals, under the regulations provided by sections 509–517 of this title. During the interval that may thus occur he may, under the direction of the Joint Committee on Printing, purchase in open market, at the lowest market price, paper necessary for the public printing.

### §517. Purchase of paper in open market
* The Joint Committee on Printing may authorize the Director of the Government Publishing Office to purchase paper in open market when they consider the quantity required so small or the want so immediate as not to justify advertisement for proposals.
