The Secretary may not deny a guarantee under this subchapter on the basis of the proposed repayment period for the note or other obligation, unless the period is more than 20 years or the Secretary determines that the period causes the guarantee to constitute an unacceptable financial risk.

#### (c) Limitation on outstanding guarantees

  * (1) enter into a contract, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, for repayment of notes or other obligations guaranteed under this subchapter;

  * (2) pledge any grant for which the issuer may become eligible under this chapter;

  * (4) furnish, at the discretion of the Secretary, such other security as may be deemed appropriate by the Secretary in making such guarantees, including increments in local tax receipts generated by the activities assisted under this chapter or disposition proceeds from the sale of land or rehabilitated property.

#### (c) Full faith and credit
* The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under this subchapter. Any such guarantee made by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the obligations for such guarantee with respect to principal and interest, and the validity of any such guarantee so made shall be incontestable in the hands of a holder of the guaranteed obligations.

### §4193. Payment of interest
