### SUBCHAPTER II—LOAN GUARANTY AND INSURANCE

### §1481. Loan guaranties and insurance
#### (a) In general
* In order to provide access to private money sources which otherwise would not be available, the Secretary may—

  * (1) guarantee not to exceed 90 per centum of the unpaid principal and interest due on any loan made to any organization of Indians having a form or organization satisfactory to the Secretary, and to individual Indians; or

  * (2) insure loans under an agreement approved by the Secretary whereby the lender will be reimbursed for losses in an amount not to exceed 15 per centum of the aggregate of such loans made by it, but not to exceed 90 per centum of the loss on any one loan.

#### (b) Eligible borrowers
* The Secretary may guarantee or insure loans under subsection (a) to both for-profit and nonprofit borrowers.

### §1482. Premium charges; deposits in Indian Loan Guaranty and Insurance Fund
* The Secretary shall fix such premium charges for the insurance and guarantee of loans as are in his judgment adequate to cover expenses and probable losses, and deposit receipts from such charges in the Indian Loan Guaranty and Insurance Fund established pursuant to section 1497(a) of this title.

### §1483. Interest rate
* Loans guaranteed or insured pursuant to this subchapter shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance, and service charge, if any) at rates not to exceed such per centum per annum on the principal obligation outstanding as the Secretary determines to be reasonable taking into consideration the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United States.

The Secretary may review each loan application individually and independently from the lender. Upon approval, the Secretary shall issue a certificate as evidence of the guaranty. Such certificate shall be issued only when, in the judgment of the Secretary, there is a reasonable prospect of repayment. No loan to an individual Indian may be guaranteed or insured which would cause the total unpaid principal indebtedness to exceed $500,000. No loan to an economic enterprise (as defined in section 1452 of this title) in excess of $250,000, or such lower amount as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate, shall be insured unless prior approval of the loan is obtained from the Secretary.

* #### (2) Compensation of fiscal transfer agent
  * A fiscal transfer agent designated under subsection (f) may be compensated through any of the fees assessed under this section and any interest earned on any funds or fees collected by the fiscal transfer agent while the funds or fees are in the control of the fiscal transfer agent and before the time at which the fiscal transfer agent is contractually required to transfer such funds to the Secretary or to transferees or other holders.

### §1486. Loans ineligible for guaranty or insurance
* Loans made by any agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government (not including an eligible Community Development Finance Institution), or by an organization of Indians from funds borrowed from the United States, and loans the interest on which is not included in gross income for the purposes of chapter 1 of title 26 shall not be eligible for guaranty or insurance hereunder.

### §1487. Loans eligible for insurance

The Secretary may cancel the uncollectable portion of any obligation, to which he has an assignment or a subrogated right under this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the borrower as may be agreed upon by the parties to the loan and approved by the Secretary.

Upon reimbursement, in whole or in part, to the lender, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States, and the lender shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States.

### §1494. Evidence of eligibility of loan for and amount of guaranty or insurance; defenses and partial defenses against original lender
* Any evidence of guaranty or insurance issued by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guaranty or insurance under the provisions of this chapter and the amount of such guaranty or insurance: _Provided_, That nothing in this section shall preclude the Secretary from establishing, as against the original lender, defenses based on fraud or material misrepresentation or bar him from establishing, by regulations in force at the date of such issuance or disbursement, whichever is the earlier, partial defenses to the amount payable on the guaranty or insurance.
