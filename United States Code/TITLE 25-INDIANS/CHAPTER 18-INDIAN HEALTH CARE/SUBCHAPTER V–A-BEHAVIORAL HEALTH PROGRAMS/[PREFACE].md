L. 111–148, title X, §10221(a), Mar. 23, 2010, 124 Stat. 935, without reference to such intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of the title's provisions by Pub. L. 111–148. A prior title VII was renumbered VIII by Pub. L. 102–573 and is classified to subchapter VI of this chapter.
