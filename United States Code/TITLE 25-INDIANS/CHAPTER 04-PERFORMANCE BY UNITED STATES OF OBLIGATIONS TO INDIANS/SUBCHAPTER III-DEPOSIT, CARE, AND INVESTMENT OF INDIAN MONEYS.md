### §151. Deposits in bank by disbursing agents
* Any United States Indian agent, superintendent, or other disbursing agent of the Indian Service may deposit Indian moneys, individual or tribal, coming into his hands as custodian, in such national bank or banks as he may select: _Provided_, That the bank or banks so selected by him shall first execute to said disbursing agent a bond, with approved surety, in such an amount as will properly safeguard the funds to be deposited. Such bond shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

### §152. Proceeds of sales of Indian lands
* All moneys received from the sales of lands that have been, or may be, ceded to the United States by Indian tribes, by treaties providing for the investment or payment to the Indians, parties thereto, of the proceeds of the lands ceded by them, respectively, after deducting the expenses of survey and sale, any sums stipulated to be advanced, and the expenses of fulfilling any engagements contained therein, shall be paid into the Treasury in the same manner that moneys received from the sales of public lands are paid into the Treasury.

### §153. Appropriation to carry out treaties
* All sums that are or may be required to be paid, and all moneys that are or may be required to be invested by the treaties mentioned in section 152 of this title are appropriated in conformity to them, and shall be drawn from the Treasury as other public moneys are drawn therefrom, under such instructions as may from time to time be given by the President.

### §154. Proceeds of sales of lands not subject to certain deductions
* No part of the expenses of the public lands service shall be deducted from the proceeds of Indian lands sold through the Bureau of Land Management, except as authorized by the treaty or agreement providing for the disposition of the lands.

### §155. Disposal of miscellaneous revenues from Indian reservations, etc.
* All miscellaneous revenues derived from Indian reservations, agencies, and schools, except those of the Five Civilized Tribes and not the result of the labor of any member of such tribe, which are not required by existing law to be otherwise disposed of, shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States under the caption "Indian moneys, proceeds of labor", and are made available for expenditure, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, for the benefit of the Indian tribes, agencies, and schools on whose behalf they are collected, subject, however, to the limitations as to tribal funds, imposed by sections 123 and 142 of this title.

### §155b. Proceeds of labor accounts; deposits limited to funds held in trust for Indian tribes or individuals
* Except in the case of funds held in trust for Indian tribes or individuals, the funds available for expenditure under the "Indian moneys, proceeds of labor" accounts authorized by section 155 of this title may be expended until September 30, 1982 for any purpose for which funds are appropriated under the subheading "Operation of Indian Programs".

* No funds shall be deposited in such "Indian money, proceeds of labor" (IMPL) accounts after September 30, 1982. The unobligated balance in IMPL accounts as of the close of business on September 30, 1982, including the income resulting from the investment of funds from such accounts prior to such date, shall be transferred to and held in escrow accounts at the locations of the IMPL accounts from which they are transferred. Funds in such escrow accounts may be invested as provided in section 162a of this title and the investment income added to such accounts. The Secretary shall determine no later than September 30, 1985 (after consultation with appropriate tribes and individual Indians) the extent to which the funds held in such escrow accounts represent income from the investment of special deposits relating to specific tribes or individual Indians. Upon such a determination by the Secretary and express acceptance of the determination by the beneficiary, the Secretary shall transfer such funds to trust accounts for such tribes or individual Indians. Not more than ten percent of the funds transferred to trust accounts for any tribe or individual Indian under this provision may be utilized to pay for legal or other representation relating to claims for such funds. Not to exceed two percent of the funds transferred from the IMPL accounts shall be available to reimburse the Bureau of Indian Affairs for administrative expenses incurred in determining ownership of the funds. Acceptance of a determination by the Secretary and the transfer of funds under this provision shall constitute a complete release and waiver of any and all claims by the beneficiary against the United States relating to the unobligated balance of IMPL accounts as of the close of business on September 30, 1982. During the period of October 1, 1985 through September 30, 1987, or earlier if a Secretarial determination on ownership and appropriate fund transfers has been completed, the funds remaining in such escrow accounts because they have not been transferred to trust accounts, may be expended subject to the approval of the Secretary for any purpose authorized under section 13 of this title and requested by the respective governing bodies of the tribes at the locations where such accounts are maintained. The unobligated balances of such escrow accounts as of the close of business on September 30, 1987, shall be deposited into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.

### §156. Deposit of funds from sales of lands and property of Five Civilized Tribes
* The net receipts from the sales of surplus and unallotted lands and other tribal property belonging to any of the Five Civilized Tribes, after deducting the necessary expense of advertising and sale, may be deposited in national or State banks in the State of Oklahoma in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, such depositories to be designated by him under such rules and regulations governing the rate of interest thereon, the time of deposit and withdrawal thereof, and the security therefor, as he may prescribe. The interest accruing on such funds may be used to defray the expense of the per capita payments of such funds.

### §157. Investments of stock required by treaties
* All investments of stock, that are or may be required by treaties with the Indians, shall be made under the direction of the President; and special accounts of the funds under such treaties shall be kept at the Treasury, and statements thereof be annually laid before Congress.

### §158. Investment of proceeds of lands
* The Secretary of the Interior shall invest in a manner which shall be in his judgment most safe and beneficial for the fund, all moneys that may be received under treaties containing stipulations for the payment to the Indians, annually, of interest upon the proceeds of the lands ceded by them; and he shall make no investment of such moneys, or of any portion, at a lower rate of interest than 5 per centum per annum.

### §159. Moneys due incompetents or orphans
* The Secretary of the Interior is directed to cause settlements to be made with all persons appointed by the Indian councils to receive moneys due to incompetent or orphan Indians, and to require all moneys found to be due to such incompetent or orphan Indians to be returned to the Treasury; and all moneys so returned shall bear interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum, until paid by order of the Secretary of the Interior to those entitled to the same. No money shall be paid to any person appointed by any Indian council to receive moneys due to incompetent or orphan Indians, but the same shall remain in the Treasury of the United States until ordered to be paid by the Secretary to those entitled to receive the same, and shall bear 6 per centum interest until so paid.

### §160. Custody of stocks or bonds held in trust for tribes
* All stocks, bonds, or other securities or evidences of indebtedness held by the Secretary of the Interior on June 10, 1876, in trust for the benefit of certain Indian tribes shall, within thirty days from that date, be transferred to the Treasurer of the United States, who shall become the custodian thereof; and it shall be the duty of said Treasurer to collect all interest falling due on said bonds, stocks, and so forth, and deposit the same in the Treasury of the United States, and to issue certificates of deposit therefor, in favor of the Secretary of the Interior, as trustee for various Indian tribes. And the Treasurer of the United States shall also become the custodian of all bonds and stocks which may be purchased for the benefit of any Indian tribe or tribes after the transfer of funds herein authorized, and shall make all purchases and sales of bonds and stocks authorized by treaty stipulations or by acts of Congress when requested so to do by the Secretary of the Interior: _Provided_, That nothing in this section shall in any manner impair or affect the supervisory and appellate powers and duties in regard to Indian affairs which may be vested in the Secretary of the Interior as trustee for various Indian tribes, except as to the custody of said bonds and the collection of interest thereon as hereinbefore mentioned.

### §161. Deposit in Treasury of trust funds
* The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to deposit, in the Treasury of the United States, any and all sums held by him on April 1, 1880, or which may be received by him, as Secretary of the Interior and trustee of various Indian tribes, on account of the redemption of United States bonds, or other stocks and securities belonging to the Indian trust fund, and all sums received on account of sales of Indian trust lands, and the sales of stocks lately purchased for temporary investment, whenever he is of the opinion that the best interests of the Indians will be promoted by such deposits, in lieu of investments; and the United States shall pay interest semiannually, from the date of deposit of any and all such sums in the United States Treasury, at the rate per annum stipulated by treaties or prescribed by law, and such payments shall be made in the usual manner, as each may become due, without further appropriation by Congress.

The said Secretary is also authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to withdraw from the United States Treasury and to deposit in banks to be selected by him the funds held in trust by the United States for the benefit of individual Indians: _Provided_, That no individual Indian money shall be deposited in any bank until the bank shall have agreed to pay interest thereon at a reasonable rate, subject, however, to the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the case of member banks, and of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the case of insured nonmember banks, except that the payment of interest may be waived in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior on any deposit which is payable on demand: _Provided further_, That no tribal or individual Indian money shall be deposited in any bank until the bank shall have furnished an acceptable bond or pledged collateral security therefor in the form of any public-debt obligations of the United States and any bonds, notes, or other obligations which are unconditionally guaranteed as to both interest and principal by the United States, except that no such bond or collateral shall be required to be furnished by any such bank which is entitled to the benefits of section 12B of the Federal Reserve Act, with respect to any deposits of such tribal or individual funds to the extent that such deposits are insured under such section: _Provided, however_, That nothing contained in this section, or in section 12B of the Federal Reserve Act, shall operate to deprive any Indian having unrestricted funds on deposit in any such bank of the full protection afforded by section 12B of the Federal Reserve Act, irrespective of any interest such Indian may have in any restricted Indian funds on deposit in the same bank to the credit of a disbursing agent of the United States. For the purpose of this section and said Act, said unrestricted funds shall constitute a separate and distinct basis for an insurance claim: _Provided further_, That the Secretary of the Interior, if he deems it advisable and for the best interest of the Indians, may invest the trust funds of any tribe or individual Indian in any public-debt obligations of the United States and in any bonds, notes, or other obligations which are unconditionally guaranteed as to both interest and principal by the United States: _And provided further_, That the foregoing shall apply to the funds of the Osage Tribe of Indians, and the individual members thereof, only with respect to the deposit of such funds in banks.
