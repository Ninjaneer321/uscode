* (a) BASIC PROGRAM.—

  * (1) AUTHORIZATION FOR FEDERAL PARTICIPATION.—Subject to the provisions of this section, Federal participation shall be permitted on the same basis and in the same manner as construction of toll-free highways is permitted under this chapter in the—

    * (B) be privately owned if the public authority with jurisdiction over the highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach has entered into a contract with 1 or more private persons to design, finance, construct, and operate the facility and the public authority will be responsible for complying with all applicable requirements of this title with respect to the facility.


  * (3) LIMITATIONS ON USE OF REVENUES.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—A public authority with jurisdiction over a toll facility shall ensure that all toll revenues received from operation of the toll facility are used only for—

      * (ii) a reasonable return on investment of any private person financing the project, as determined by the State or interstate compact of States concerned;

      * (iii) any costs necessary for the improvement and proper operation and maintenance of the toll facility, including reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation;

      * (iv) if the toll facility is subject to a public-private partnership agreement, payments that the party holding the right to toll revenues owes to the other party under the public-private partnership agreement; and

  * (4) SPECIAL RULE FOR FUNDING.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a toll facility under the jurisdiction of a public authority of a State (other than the State transportation department), on request of the State transportation department and subject to such terms and conditions as the department and public authority may agree, the Secretary, working through the State department of transportation, shall reimburse the public authority for the Federal share of the costs of construction of the project carried out on the toll facility under this subsection in the same manner and to the same extent as the department would be reimbursed if the project was being carried out by the department.

    * (B) SOURCE.—The reimbursement of funds under this paragraph shall be from sums apportioned to the State under this chapter and available for obligations on projects on the Federal-aid highways in the State on which the project is being carried out.
