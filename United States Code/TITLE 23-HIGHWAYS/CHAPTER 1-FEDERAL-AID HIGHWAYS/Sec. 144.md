### §144. National bridge and tunnel inventory and inspection standards
* (a) FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.—

  * (1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—

    * (A) the condition of the bridges of the United States has improved since the date of enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (Public Law 105–178; 112 Stat. 107), yet continued improvement to bridge conditions is essential to protect the safety of the traveling public and allow for the efficient movement of people and goods on which the economy of the United States relies; and

    * (B) the systematic preventative maintenance of bridges, and replacement and rehabilitation of deficient bridges, should be undertaken through an overall asset management approach to transportation investment.


  * (2) DECLARATIONS.—Congress declares that it is in the vital interest of the United States—

    * (A) to inventory, inspect, and improve the condition of the highway bridges and tunnels of the United States;

    * (B) to use a data-driven, risk-based approach and cost-effective strategy for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, and rehabilitation of highway bridges and tunnels to ensure safety and extended service life;

    * (C) to use performance-based bridge management systems to assist States in making timely investments;

    * (D) to ensure accountability and link performance outcomes to investment decisions; and

    * (E) to ensure connectivity and access for residents of rural areas of the United States through strategic investments in National Highway System bridges and bridges on all public roads.


* (b) NATIONAL BRIDGE AND TUNNEL INVENTORIES.—The Secretary, in consultation with the States and Federal agencies with jurisdiction over highway bridges and tunnels, shall—

  * (1) inventory all highway bridges on public roads, on and off Federal-aid highways, including tribally owned and Federally owned bridges, that are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads;

  * (2) inventory all tunnels on public roads, on and off Federal-aid highways, including tribally owned and Federally owned tunnels;

  * (3) classify the bridges according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, including the potential impacts to emergency evacuation routes and to regional and national freight and passenger mobility if the serviceability of the bridge is restricted or diminished;

  * (4) based on that classification, assign each a risk-based priority for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, or rehabilitation; and

  * (5) determine the cost of replacing each structurally deficient bridge identified under this subsection with a comparable facility or the cost of rehabilitating the bridge.


* (c) GENERAL BRIDGE AUTHORITY.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the General Bridge Act of 1946 (33 U.S.C. 525 et seq.) shall apply to bridges authorized to be replaced, in whole or in part, by this title.

  * (2) EXCEPTION.—Section 502(b) of the General Bridge Act of 1946 (33 U.S.C. 525(b)) and section 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401), shall not apply to any bridge constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, or replaced with assistance under this title, if the bridge is over waters that—

    * (A) are not used and are not susceptible to use in the natural condition of the water or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce; and

    * (B) are—

      * (i) not tidal; or

      * (ii) if tidal, used only by recreational boating, fishing, and other small vessels that are less than 21 feet in length.

    * (A) annually revise the inventories authorized by subsection (b); and

    * (B) submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate a report on the inventories.


  * (2) INSPECTION REPORT.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the MAP–21, each State and appropriate Federal agency shall report element level data to the Secretary, as each bridge is inspected pursuant to this section, for all highway bridges on the National Highway System.

  * (3) GUIDANCE.—The Secretary shall provide guidance to States and Federal agencies for implementation of this subsection, while respecting the existing inspection schedule of each State.

  * (4) BRIDGES NOT ON NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM.—The Secretary shall—

    * (A) conduct a study on the benefits, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of requiring element-level data collection for bridges not on the National Highway System; and

    * (B) submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate a report on the results of the study.


* (e) BRIDGES WITHOUT TAXING POWERS.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any bridge that is owned and operated by an agency that does not have taxing powers and whose functions include operating a federally assisted public transit system subsidized by toll revenues shall be eligible for assistance under this title, but the amount of such assistance shall in no event exceed the cumulative amount which such agency has expended for capital and operating costs to subsidize such transit system.

  * (2) INSUFFICIENT ASSETS.—Before authorizing an expenditure of funds under this subsection, the Secretary shall determine that the applicant agency has insufficient reserves, surpluses, and projected revenues (over and above those required for bridge and transit capital and operating costs) to fund the bridge project or activity eligible for assistance under this title.

  * (3) CREDITING OF NON-FEDERAL FUNDS.—Any non-Federal funds expended for the seismic retrofit of the bridge may be credited toward the non-Federal share required as a condition of receipt of any Federal funds for seismic retrofit of the bridge made available after the date of the expenditure.


* (f) REPLACEMENT OF DESTROYED BRIDGES AND FERRY BOAT SERVICE.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State may use the funds apportioned under section 104(b)(2) to construct any bridge that replaces—
