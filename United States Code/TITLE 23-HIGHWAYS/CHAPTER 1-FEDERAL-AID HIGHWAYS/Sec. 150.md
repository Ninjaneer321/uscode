      * (iv) the data elements that are necessary to collect and maintain standardized data to carry out a performance-based approach.


    * (B) REGIONS.—In establishing minimum condition levels under subparagraph (A)(iii), if the Secretary determines that various geographic regions of the United States experience disparate factors contributing to the condition of pavement on the Interstate System in those regions, the Secretary may establish different minimum levels for each region.


  * (4) HIGHWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.—For the purpose of carrying out section 148, the Secretary shall establish measures for States to use to assess—

    * (A) serious injuries and fatalities per vehicle mile traveled; and
