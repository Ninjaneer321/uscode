* (b) DECLARATION OF POLICY.—

  * (1) ACCELERATION OF CONSTRUCTION OF FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAY SYSTEMS.—Congress declares that it is in the national interest to accelerate the construction of Federal-aid highway systems, including the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense, because many of the highways (or portions of the highways) are inadequate to meet the needs of local and interstate commerce for the national and civil defense.

  * (2) COMPLETION OF INTERSTATE SYSTEM.—Congress declares that the prompt and early completion of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (referred to in this section as the "Interstate System"), so named because of its primary importance to the national defense, is essential to the national interest. It is the intent of Congress that the Interstate System be completed as nearly as practicable over the period of availability of the forty years' appropriations authorized for the purpose of expediting its construction, reconstruction, or improvement, inclusive of necessary tunnels and bridges, through the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, under section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (70 Stat. 374), and that the entire system in all States be brought to simultaneous completion. Insofar as possible in consonance with this objective, existing highways located on an interstate route shall be used to the extent that such use is practicable, suitable, and feasible, it being the intent that local needs, to the extent practicable, suitable, and feasible, shall be given equal consideration with the needs of interstate commerce.

  * (3) TRANSPORTATION NEEDS OF 21ST CENTURY.—Congress declares that—

    * (A) it is in the national interest to preserve and enhance the surface transportation system to meet the needs of the United States for the 21st Century;

    * (B) the current urban and long distance personal travel and freight movement demands have surpassed the original forecasts and travel demand patterns are expected to continue to change;

    * (C) continued planning for and investment in surface transportation is critical to ensure the surface transportation system adequately meets the changing travel demands of the future;

    * (D) among the foremost needs that the surface transportation system must meet to provide for a strong and vigorous national economy are safe, efficient, and reliable—

      * (i) national and interregional personal mobility (including personal mobility in rural and urban areas) and reduced congestion;

      * (ii) flow of interstate and international commerce and freight transportation; and

      * (iii) travel movements essential for national security;


    * (E) special emphasis should be devoted to providing safe and efficient access for the type and size of commercial and military vehicles that access designated National Highway System intermodal freight terminals;

    * (F) the connection between land use and infrastructure is significant;

    * (G) transportation should play a significant role in promoting economic growth, improving the environment, and sustaining the quality of life; and

    * (H) the Secretary should take appropriate actions to preserve and enhance the Interstate System to meet the needs of the 21st Century.


  * (4) EXPEDITED PROJECT DELIVERY.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—Congress declares that it is in the national interest to expedite the delivery of surface transportation projects by substantially reducing the average length of the environmental review process.

    * (B) POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.—Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that—

      * (i) the Secretary shall have the lead role among Federal agencies in carrying out the environmental review process for surface transportation projects;

      * (ii) each Federal agency shall cooperate with the Secretary to expedite the environmental review process for surface transportation projects;

      * (iii) project sponsors shall not be prohibited from carrying out preconstruction project development activities concurrently with the environmental review process;

      * (iv) programmatic approaches shall be used to reduce the need for project-by-project reviews and decisions by Federal agencies; and

      * (v) the Secretary shall identify opportunities for project sponsors to assume responsibilities of the Secretary where such responsibilities can be assumed in a manner that protects public health, the environment, and public participation.


* (c) It is the sense of Congress that under existing law no part of any sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure upon any Federal-aid highway which has been apportioned pursuant to the provisions of this title shall be impounded or withheld from obligation, for purposes and projects as provided in this title, by any officer or employee in the executive branch of the Federal Government, except such specific sums as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, are necessary to be withheld from obligation for specific periods of time to assure that sufficient amounts will be available in the Highway Trust Fund to defray the expenditures which will be required to be made from such fund.

* (d) No funds authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund shall be expended by or on behalf of any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality other than the Federal Highway Administration unless funds for such expenditure are identified and included as a line item in an appropriation Act and are to meet obligations of the United States heretofore or hereafter incurred under this title attributable to the construction of Federal-aid highways or highway planning, research, or development, or as otherwise specifically authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund by Federal-aid highway legislation.

* (e) It is the national policy that to the maximum extent possible the procedures to be utilized by the Secretary and all other affected heads of Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities for carrying out this title and any other provision of law relating to the Federal highway programs shall encourage the substantial minimization of paperwork and interagency decision procedures and the best use of available manpower and funds so as to prevent needless duplication and unnecessary delays at all levels of government.
