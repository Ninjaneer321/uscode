Any action under this section shall be brought in the District Court of the United States for the district in which the tax return preparer resides or has his principal place of business or in which the taxpayer with respect to whose tax return the action is brought resides. The court may exercise its jurisdiction over such action (as provided in section 7402(a)) separate and apart from any other action brought by the United States against such tax return preparer or any taxpayer.

#### (b) Adjudication and decrees
* In any action under subsection (a), if the court finds—

    * (C) guaranteed the payment of any tax refund or the allowance of any tax credit, or

    * (D) engaged in any other fraudulent or deceptive conduct which substantially interferes with the proper administration of the Internal Revenue laws, and


  * (2) that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent the recurrence of such conduct,


* the court may enjoin such person from further engaging in such conduct. If the court finds that a tax return preparer has continually or repeatedly engaged in any conduct described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of this subsection and that an injunction prohibiting such conduct would not be sufficient to prevent such person's interference with the proper administration of this title, the court may enjoin such person from acting as a tax return preparer.

#### (b) Adjudication and decree
* In any action under subsection (a), if the court finds—

  * (1) that the person has engaged in any specified conduct, and

  * (2) that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent recurrence of such conduct,


* the court may enjoin such person from engaging in such conduct or in any other activity subject to penalty under this title.

#### (c) Specified conduct
* For purposes of this section, the term "specified conduct" means any action, or failure to take action, which is—

  * (1) subject to penalty under section 6700, 6701, 6707, or 6708, or

  * (2) in violation of any requirement under regulations issued under section 330 of title 31, United States Code.

Any action under this section shall be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which such organization has its principal place of business or for any district in which it has made political expenditures.

  * (2) injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent future political expenditures,
