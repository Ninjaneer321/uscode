### **Subchapter D—Court Review of Tax Court Decisions**

### §7481. Date when Tax Court decision becomes final
#### (a) Reviewable decisions
* Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (d), the decision of the Tax Court shall become final—

* #### (1) Timely notice of appeal not filed
  * Upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a notice of appeal, if no such notice has been duly filed within such time; or

* #### (2) Decision affirmed or appeal dismissed
  * #### (A) Petition for certiorari not filed on time
    * Upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari, if the decision of the Tax Court has been affirmed or the appeal dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals and no petition for certiorari has been duly filed; or

  * #### (B) Petition for certiorari denied
    * Upon the denial of a petition for certiorari, if the decision of the Tax Court has been affirmed or the appeal dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals; or

  * #### (C) After mandate of Supreme Court
    * Upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance of the mandate of the Supreme Court, if such Court directs that the decision of the Tax Court be affirmed or the appeal dismissed.

* #### (3) Decision modified or reversed
  * #### (A) Upon mandate of Supreme Court
    * If the Supreme Court directs that the decision of the Tax Court be modified or reversed, the decision of the Tax Court rendered in accordance with the mandate of the Supreme Court shall become final upon the expiration of 30 days from the time it was rendered, unless within such 30 days either the Secretary or the taxpayer has instituted proceedings to have such decision corrected to accord with the mandate, in which event the decision of the Tax Court shall become final when so corrected.

  * #### (B) Upon mandate of the Court of Appeals
    * If the decision of the Tax Court is modified or reversed by the United States Court of Appeals, and if—

      * (i) the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari has expired and no such petition has been duly filed, or

      * (ii) the petition for certiorari has been denied, or

      * (iii) the decision of the United States Court of Appeals has been affirmed by the Supreme Court, then the decision of the Tax Court rendered in accordance with the mandate of the United States Court of Appeals shall become final on the expiration of 30 days from the time such decision of the Tax Court was rendered, unless within such 30 days either the Secretary or the taxpayer has instituted proceedings to have such decision corrected so that it will accord with the mandate, in which event the decision of the Tax Court shall become final when so corrected.

* #### (4) Rehearing
  * If the Supreme Court orders a rehearing; or if the case is remanded by the United States Court of Appeals to the Tax Court for a rehearing, and if—

    * (A) the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari has expired and no such petition has been duly filed, or

    * (B) the petition for certiorari has been denied, or

    * (C) the decision of the United States Court of Appeals has been affirmed by the Supreme Court,


* then the decision of the Tax Court rendered upon such rehearing shall become final in the same manner as though no prior decision of the Tax Court has been rendered.

* #### (5) Definition of "mandate"
  * As used in this section, the term "mandate", in case a mandate has been recalled prior to the expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance thereof, means the final mandate.

#### (b) Nonreviewable decisions
* The decision of the Tax Court in a proceeding conducted under section 7436(c) or 7463 shall become final upon the expiration of 90 days after the decision is entered.

#### (c) Jurisdiction over interest determinations
* #### (1) In general
  * Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, within 1 year after the date the decision of the Tax Court becomes final under subsection (a) in a case to which this subsection applies, the taxpayer files a motion in the Tax Court for a redetermination of the amount of interest involved, then the Tax Court may reopen the case solely to determine whether the taxpayer has made an overpayment of such interest or the Secretary has made an underpayment of such interest and the amount thereof.

* #### (2) Cases to which this subsection applies
  * This subsection shall apply where—

    * (A)(i) an assessment has been made by the Secretary under section 6215 which includes interest as imposed by this title, and

    * (ii) the taxpayer has paid the entire amount of the deficiency plus interest claimed by the Secretary, and

    * (B) the Tax Court finds under section 6512(b) that the taxpayer has made an overpayment.

* #### (3) Special rules
  * If the Tax Court determines under this subsection that the taxpayer has made an overpayment of interest or that the Secretary has made an underpayment of interest, then that determination shall be treated under section 6512(b)(1) as a determination of an overpayment of tax. An order of the Tax Court redetermining interest, when entered upon the records of the court, shall be reviewable in the same manner as a decision of the Tax Court.

#### (d) Decisions relating to estate tax extended under section 6166
* If with respect to a decedent's estate subject to a decision of the Tax Court—

  * (1) the time for payment of an amount of tax imposed by chapter 11 is extended under section 6166, and

  * (2) there is treated as an administrative expense under section 2053 either—

    * (A) any amount of interest which a decedent's estate pays on any portion of the tax imposed by section 2001 on such estate for which the time of payment is extended under section 6166, or

    * (B) interest on any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax imposed by a State on such estate during the period of the extension of time for payment under section 6166,


* then, upon a motion by the petitioner in such case in which such time for payment of tax has been extended under section 6166, the Tax Court may reopen the case solely to modify the Court's decision to reflect such estate's entitlement to a deduction for such administration expenses under section 2053 and may hold further trial solely with respect to the claim for such deduction if, within the discretion of the Tax Court, such a hearing is deemed necessary. An order of the Tax Court disposing of a motion under this subsection shall be reviewable in the same manner as a decision of the Tax Court, but only with respect to the matters determined in such order.

### §7482. Courts of review
#### (a) Jurisdiction
* #### (1) In general
  * The United States Courts of Appeals (other than the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Tax Court, except as provided in section 1254 of Title 28 of the United States Code, in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury; and the judgment of any such court shall be final, except that it shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari, in the manner provided in section 1254 of Title 28 of the United States Code.

* #### (2) Interlocutory orders
  * #### (A) In general
    * When any judge of the Tax Court includes in an interlocutory order a statement that a controlling question of law is involved with respect to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from that order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, the United States Court of Appeals may, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within 10 days after the entry of such order. Neither the application for nor the granting of an appeal under this paragraph shall stay proceedings in the Tax Court, unless a stay is ordered by a judge of the Tax Court or by the United States Court of Appeals which has jurisdiction of the appeal or a judge of that court.

  * #### (B) Order treated as Tax Court decision
    * For purposes of subsections (b) and (c), an order described in this paragraph shall be treated as a decision of the Tax Court.

  * #### (C) Venue for review of subsequent proceedings
    * If a United States Court of Appeals permits an appeal to be taken from an order described in subparagraph (A), except as provided in subsection (b)(2), any subsequent review of the decision of the Tax Court in the proceeding shall be made by such Court of Appeals.

* #### (3) Certain orders entered under section 6213(a)
  * An order of the Tax Court which is entered under authority of section 6213(a) and which resolves a proceeding to restrain assessment or collection shall be treated as a decision of the Tax Court for purposes of this section and shall be subject to the same review by the United States Court of Appeals as a similar order of a district court.

#### (b) Venue
* #### (1) In general
  * Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), such decisions may be reviewed by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which is located—

    * (A) in the case of a petitioner seeking redetermination of tax liability other than a corporation, the legal residence of the petitioner,

    * (B) in the case of a corporation seeking redetermination of tax liability, the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation, or, if it has no principal place of business or principal office or agency in any judicial circuit, then the office to which was made the return of the tax in respect of which the liability arises,

    * (C) in the case of a person seeking a declaratory decision under section 7476, the principal place of business, or principal office or agency of the employer,

    * (D) in the case of an organization seeking a declaratory decision under section 7428, the principal office or agency of the organization,

    * (E) in the case of a petition under section 6234, the principal place of business of the partnership,

    * (F) in the case of a petition under section 6015(e), the legal residence of the petitioner, or

    * (G) in the case of a petition under section 6320 or 6330—

      * (i) the legal residence of the petitioner if the petitioner is an individual, and

      * (ii) the principal place of business or principal office or agency if the petitioner is an entity other than an individual.


* If for any reason no subparagraph of the preceding sentence applies, then such decisions may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. For purposes of this paragraph, the legal residence, principal place of business, or principal office or agency referred to herein shall be determined as of the time the petition seeking redetermination of tax liability was filed with the Tax Court or as of the time the petition seeking a declaratory decision under section 7428 or 7476, or the petition under section 6234, was filed with the Tax Court.

* #### (2) By agreement
  * Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), such decisions may be reviewed by any United States Court of Appeals which may be designated by the Secretary and the taxpayer by stipulation in writing.

* #### (3) Declaratory judgment actions relating to status of certain governmental obligations
  * In the case of any decision of the Tax Court in a proceeding under section 7478, such decision may only be reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

#### (c) Powers
* #### (1) To affirm, modify, or reverse
  * Upon such review, such courts shall have power to affirm or, if the decision of the Tax Court is not in accordance with law, to modify or to reverse the decision of the Tax Court, with or without remanding the case for a rehearing, as justice may require.

* #### (2) To make rules
  * Rules for review of decisions of the Tax Court shall be those prescribed by the Supreme Court under section 2072 of title 28 of the United States Code.

* #### (3) To require additional security
  * Nothing in section 7483 shall be construed as relieving the petitioner from making or filing such undertakings as the court may require as a condition of or in connection with the review.

* #### (4) To impose penalties
  * The United States Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court shall have the power to require the taxpayer to pay to the United States a penalty in any case where the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed and it appears that the appeal was instituted or maintained primarily for delay or that the taxpayer's position in the appeal is frivolous or groundless.

### §7483. Notice of appeal
* Review of a decision of the Tax Court shall be obtained by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the Tax Court within 90 days after the decision of the Tax Court is entered. If a timely notice of appeal is filed by one party, any other party may take an appeal by filing a notice of appeal within 120 days after the decision of the Tax Court is entered.

### §7484. Change of incumbent in office
* When the incumbent of the office of Secretary changes, no substitution of the name of his successor shall be required in proceedings pending before any appellate court reviewing the action of the Tax Court.

### §7485. Bond to stay assessment and collection
#### (a) Upon notice of appeal
* Notwithstanding any provision of law imposing restrictions on the assessment and collection of deficiencies, the review under section 7483 shall not operate as a stay of assessment or collection of any portion of the amount of the deficiency determined by the Tax Court unless a notice of appeal in respect of such portion is duly filed by the taxpayer, and then only if the taxpayer—

  * (1) on or before the time his notice of appeal is filed has filed with the Tax Court a bond in a sum fixed by the Tax Court not exceeding double the amount of the portion of the deficiency in respect of which the notice of appeal is filed, and with surety approved by the Tax Court, conditioned upon the payment of the deficiency as finally determined, together with any interest, additional amounts, or additions to the tax provided for by law, or

  * (2) has filed a jeopardy bond under the income or estate tax laws.


* If as a result of a waiver of the restrictions on the assessment and collection of a deficiency any part of the amount determined by the Tax Court is paid after the filing of the appeal bond, such bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.

#### (b) Bond in case of appeal of certain partnership-related decisions
* The condition of subsection (a) shall be satisfied if the partnership duly files notice of appeal from a decision under section 6234 and on or before the time the notice of appeal is filed with the Tax Court, a bond in an amount fixed by the Tax Court is filed, and with surety approved by the Tax Court, conditioned upon the payment of deficiencies attributable to the partnership-related items (as defined in section 6241) to which that decision relates as finally determined, together with any interest, penalties, additional amounts, or additions to the tax provided by law. Unless otherwise stipulated by the parties, the amount fixed by the Tax Court shall be based upon its estimate of the aggregate liability of the parties to the action.

* In cases where assessment or collection has not been stayed by the filing of a bond, then if the amount of the deficiency determined by the Tax Court is disallowed in whole or in part by the court of review, the amount so disallowed shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer, without the making of claim therefor, or, if collection has not been made, shall be abated.
