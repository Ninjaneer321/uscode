* such individual shall be treated as if such individual were a member of the generation which is 1 generation below the lower of the transferor's generation or the generation assignment of the youngest living ancestor of such individual who is also a descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor's spouse or former spouse), and the generation assignment of any descendant of such individual shall be adjusted accordingly.

* #### (2) Limited application of subsection to collateral heirs
  * This subsection shall not apply with respect to a transfer to any individual who is not a lineal descendant of the transferor (or the transferor's spouse or former spouse) if, at the time of the transfer, such transferor has any living lineal descendant.

### §2652. Other definitions
#### (a) Transferor
* For purposes of this chapter—

* #### (1) In general

    * (A) in the case of any property subject to the tax imposed by chapter 11, the decedent, and

    * (B) in the case of any property subject to the tax imposed by chapter 12, the donor.


* An individual shall be treated as transferring any property with respect to which such individual is the transferor.

* #### (2) Gift-splitting by married couples
  * If, under section 2513, one-half of a gift is treated as made by an individual and one-half of such gift is treated as made by the spouse of such individual, such gift shall be so treated for purposes of this chapter.

* #### (3) Special election for qualified terminable interest property
  * In the case of—

    * (A) any trust with respect to which a deduction is allowed to the decedent under section 2056 by reason of subsection (b)(7) thereof, and

    * (B) any trust with respect to which a deduction to the donor spouse is allowed under section 2523 by reason of subsection (f) thereof,


* the estate of the decedent or the donor spouse, as the case may be, may elect to treat all of the property in such trust for purposes of this chapter as if the election to be treated as qualified terminable interest property had not been made.

#### (b) Trust and trustee
* #### (1) Trust
  * The term "trust" includes any arrangement (other than an estate) which, although not a trust, has substantially the same effect as a trust.

* #### (2) Trustee
  * In the case of an arrangement which is not a trust but which is treated as a trust under this subsection, the term "trustee" shall mean the person in actual or constructive possession of the property subject to such arrangement.

* #### (3) Examples
  * Arrangements to which this subsection applies include arrangements involving life estates and remainders, estates for years, and insurance and annuity contracts.

#### (c) Interest
* #### (1) In general
  * A person has an interest in property held in trust if (at the time the determination is made) such person—

    * (A) has a right (other than a future right) to receive income or corpus from the trust,

    * (B) is a permissible current recipient of income or corpus from the trust and is not described in section 2055(a), or

    * (C) is described in section 2055(a) and the trust is—

      * (i) a charitable remainder annuity trust,

      * (ii) a charitable remainder unitrust within the meaning of section 664, or

      * (iii) a pooled income fund within the meaning of section 642(c)(5).

* #### (2) Certain interests disregarded

* #### (3) Certain support obligations disregarded
  * The fact that income or corpus of the trust may be used to satisfy an obligation of support arising under State law shall be disregarded in determining whether a person has an interest in the trust, if—

    * (A) such use is discretionary, or

    * (B) such use is pursuant to the provisions of any State law substantially equivalent to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.

#### (d) Executor
* For purposes of this chapter, the term "executor" has the meaning given such term by section 2203.

### §2653. Taxation of multiple skips
#### (a) General rule
* For purposes of this chapter, if—

  * (1) there is a generation-skipping transfer of any property, and

  * (2) immediately after such transfer such property is held in trust,


* for purposes of applying this chapter (other than section 2651) to subsequent transfers from the portion of such trust attributable to such property, the trust will be treated as if the transferor of such property were assigned to the first generation above the highest generation of any person who has an interest in such trust immediately after the transfer.

#### (b) Trust retains inclusion ratio
* #### (1) In general
  * Except as provided in paragraph (2), the provisions of subsection (a) shall not affect the inclusion ratio determined with respect to any trust. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, proper adjustment shall be made to the inclusion ratio with respect to such trust to take into account any tax under this chapter borne by such trust which is imposed by this chapter on the transfer described in subsection (a).

* #### (2) Special rule for pour-over trust
  * #### (A) In general
    * If the generation-skipping transfer referred to in subsection (a) involves the transfer of property from 1 trust to another trust (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the "pour-over trust"), the inclusion ratio for the pour-over trust shall be determined by treating the nontax portion of such distribution as if it were a part of a GST exemption allocated to such trust.

  * #### (B) Nontax portion
    * For purposes of subparagraph (A), the nontax portion of any distribution is the amount of such distribution multiplied by the applicable fraction which applies to such distribution.

### §2654. Special rules
#### (a) Basis adjustment
* #### (1) In general
  * Except as provided in paragraph (2), if property is transferred in a generation-skipping transfer, the basis of such property shall be increased (but not above the fair market value of such property) by an amount equal to that portion of the tax imposed by section 2601 with respect to the transfer which is attributable to the excess of the fair market value of such property over its adjusted basis immediately before the transfer. The preceding shall be applied after any basis adjustment under section 1015 with respect to the transfer.

* #### (2) Certain transfers at death
  * If property is transferred in a taxable termination which occurs at the same time as and as a result of the death of an individual, the basis of such property shall be adjusted in a manner similar to the manner provided under section 1014(a); except that, if the inclusion ratio with respect to such property is less than 1, any increase or decrease in basis shall be limited by multiplying such increase or decrease (as the case may be) by the inclusion ratio.

#### (b) Certain trusts treated as separate trusts
* For purposes of this chapter—

  * (1) the portions of a trust attributable to transfers from different transferors shall be treated as separate trusts, and

  * (2) substantially separate and independent shares of different beneficiaries in a trust shall be treated as separate trusts.


* Except as provided in the preceding sentence, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing a single trust to be treated as 2 or more trusts. For purposes of this subsection, a trust shall be treated as part of an estate during any period that the trust is so treated under section 645.

#### (c) Disclaimers
    *  **For provisions relating to the effect of a qualified disclaimer for purposes of this chapter, see section 2518.**

#### (d) Limitation on personal liability of trustee
* A trustee shall not be personally liable for any increase in the tax imposed by section 2601 which is attributable to the fact that—

  * (1) section 2642(c) (relating to exemption of certain nontaxable gifts) does not apply to a transfer to the trust which was made during the life of the transferor and for which a gift tax return was not filed, or

  * (2) the inclusion ratio with respect to the trust is greater than the amount of such ratio as computed on the basis of the return on which was made (or was deemed made) an allocation of the GST exemption to property transferred to such trust.


* The preceding sentence shall not apply if the trustee has knowledge of facts sufficient reasonably to conclude that a gift tax return was required to be filed or that the inclusion ratio was erroneous.
