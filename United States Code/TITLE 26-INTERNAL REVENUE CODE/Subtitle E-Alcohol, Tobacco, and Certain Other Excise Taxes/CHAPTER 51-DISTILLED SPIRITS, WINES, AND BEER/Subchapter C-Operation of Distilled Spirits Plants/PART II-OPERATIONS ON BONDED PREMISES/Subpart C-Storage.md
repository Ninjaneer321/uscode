### §5231. Entry for deposit
* All distilled spirits entered for deposit on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant under section 5211 shall, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, be deposited in the facilities on the bonded premises designated in the entry for deposit.

### §5232. Imported distilled spirits
#### (a) Transfer to distilled spirits plant without payment of tax
* Distilled spirits imported or brought into the United States in bulk containers may, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, be withdrawn from customs custody and transferred in such bulk containers or by pipeline to the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant without payment of the internal revenue tax imposed on such distilled spirits. The person operating the bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant to which such spirits are transferred shall become liable for the tax on distilled spirits withdrawn from customs custody under this section upon release of the spirits from customs custody, and the importer, or the person bringing such distilled spirits into the United States, shall thereupon be relieved of his liability for such tax.

#### (b) Withdrawals, etc.
* Distilled spirits transferred pursuant to subsection (a)—

  * (1) may be redistilled or denatured only if of 185 degrees or more of proof, and

  * (2) may be withdrawn for any purpose authorized by this chapter, in the same manner as domestic distilled spirits.

### §5235. Bottling of alcohol for industrial purposes
* Alcohol for industrial purposes may be bottled, labeled, and cased on bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant prior to payment or determination of tax, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe.

### §5236. Discontinuance of storage facilities and transfer of distilled spirits
* When the Secretary finds any facilities for the storage of distilled spirits on bonded premises to be unsafe or unfit for use, or the spirits contained therein subject to great loss or wastage he may require the discontinuance of the use of such facilities and require the spirits contained therein to be transferred to such other storage facilities as he may designate. Such transfer shall be made at such time and under such supervision as the Secretary may require and the expense of the transfer shall be paid by the owner or the warehouseman of the distilled spirits. Whenever the owner of such distilled spirits or the warehouseman fails to make such transfer within the time prescribed, or to pay the just and proper expense of such transfer, as ascertained and determined by the Secretary, such distilled spirits may be seized and sold by the Secretary in the same manner as goods are sold on distraint for taxes, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the payment of the taxes due thereon and the cost and expenses of such sale and removal, and the balance paid over to the owner of such distilled spirits.
