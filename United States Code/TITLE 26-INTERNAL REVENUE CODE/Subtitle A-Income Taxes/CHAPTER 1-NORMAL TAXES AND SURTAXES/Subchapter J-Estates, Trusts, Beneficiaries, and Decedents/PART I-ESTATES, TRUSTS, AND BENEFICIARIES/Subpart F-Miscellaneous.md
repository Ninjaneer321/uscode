### SUBPART F—MISCELLANEOUS

### §681. Limitation on charitable deduction
#### (a) Trade or business income
* In computing the deduction allowable under section 642(c) to a trust, no amount otherwise allowable under section 642(c) as a deduction shall be allowed as a deduction with respect to income of the taxable year which is allocable to its unrelated business income for such year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "unrelated business income" means an amount equal to the amount which, if such trust were exempt from tax under section 501(a) by reason of section 501(c)(3), would be computed as its unrelated business taxable income under section 512 (relating to income derived from certain business activities and from certain property acquired with borrowed funds).

* Subsection (a) shall not apply to any transfer to a pooled income fund (within the meaning of section 642(c)(5)).

  * (2) the adjusted basis (for purposes of determining gain) of such property in the hands of the transferor.

#### (c) Application of rate schedule
* Section 1(e) shall be applied to each qualified funeral trust by treating each beneficiary's interest in each such trust as a separate trust.

#### (d) Treatment of amounts refunded to purchaser on cancellation
* No gain or loss shall be recognized to a purchaser of a contract described in subsection (b)(1) by reason of any payment from such trust to such purchaser by reason of cancellation of such contract. If any payment referred to in the preceding sentence consists of property other than money, the basis of such property in the hands of such purchaser shall be the same as the trust's basis in such property immediately before the payment.
