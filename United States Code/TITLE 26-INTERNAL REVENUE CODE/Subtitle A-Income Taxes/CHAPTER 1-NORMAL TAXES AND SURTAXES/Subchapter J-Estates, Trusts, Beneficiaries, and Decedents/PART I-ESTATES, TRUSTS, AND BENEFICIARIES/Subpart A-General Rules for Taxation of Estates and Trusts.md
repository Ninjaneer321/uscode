    * (B) in which the property transferred by each donor is commingled with property transferred by other donors who have made or make similar transfers,

    * (C) which cannot have investments in securities which are exempt from the taxes imposed by this subtitle,

  * If, at any time, a beneficial interest in an electing Settlement Trust may be disposed of to a person in a manner which would not be permitted by section 7(h) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1606(h)) if such interest were Settlement Common Stock—

    * (A) no election may be made under subsection (c) with respect to such trust, and

* In no event shall the increase under clause (iii) exceed the fair market value of the trust's assets as of the date the beneficial interest of the trust first becomes so disposable. The earnings and profits of the sponsoring Native Corporation shall be adjusted as of the last day of such taxable year by the amount of earnings and profits so included in the distributable net income of the trust.

    * (B) at any time after such disposition of stock is first permitted, such corporation transfers assets to a Settlement Trust,


* paragraph (1)(B) shall be applied to such trust on and after the date of the transfer in the same manner as if the trust permitted dispositions of beneficial interests in the trust in a manner not permitted by such section 7(h).
