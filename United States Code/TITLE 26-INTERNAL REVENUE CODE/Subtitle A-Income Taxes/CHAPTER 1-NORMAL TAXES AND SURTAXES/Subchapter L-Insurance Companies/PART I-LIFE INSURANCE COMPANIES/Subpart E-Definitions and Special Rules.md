#### (e) Guaranteed renewable contracts
* For purposes of this part, guaranteed renewable life, accident, and health insurance shall be treated in the same manner as noncancellable life, accident, and health insurance.

#### (f) Amounts not involving life, accident, or health contingencies
* For purposes only of determining under subsection (a) whether or not an insurance company is a life insurance company, amounts set aside and held at interest to satisfy obligations under contracts which do not contain permanent guarantees with respect to life, accident, or health contingencies shall not be included in reserves described in paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (c).

#### (g) Burial and funeral benefit insurance companies
* A burial or funeral benefit insurance company engaged directly in the manufacture of funeral supplies or the performance of funeral services shall not be taxable under this part but shall be taxable under section 831.

### §817. Treatment of variable contracts
#### (a) Increases and decreases in reserves
* For purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of section 807, the sum of the items described in section 807(c) taken into account as of the close of the taxable year with respect to any variable contract shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be adjusted—

  * (1) by subtracting therefrom an amount equal to the sum of the amounts added from time to time (for the taxable year) to the reserves separately accounted for in accordance with subsection (c) by reason of appreciation in value of assets (whether or not the assets have been disposed of), and

  * (2) by adding thereto an amount equal to the sum of the amounts subtracted from time to time (for the taxable year) from such reserves by reason of depreciation in value of assets (whether or not the assets have been disposed of).


* The deduction allowable for items described in paragraphs (1) and (6) of section 805(a) with respect to variable contracts shall be reduced to the extent that the amount of such items is increased for the taxable year by appreciation (or increased to the extent that the amount of such items is decreased for the taxable year by depreciation) not reflected in adjustments under the preceding sentence.

* to the extent such appreciation and depreciation are from time to time reflected in the increases and decreases in reserves or other items referred to in subsection (a) with respect to such contracts.

#### (c) Separate accounting
* For purposes of this part, a life insurance company which issues variable contracts shall separately account for the various income, exclusion, deduction, asset, reserve, and other liability items properly attributable to such variable contracts. For such items as are not accounted for directly, separate accounting shall be made—

    * (B) is a life insurance contract, or

    * (C) provides for funding of insurance on retired lives as described in section 807(c)(6), and

    * (A) in the case of an annuity contract, the amounts paid in, or the amount paid out, reflect the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account,

    * (B) in the case of a life insurance contract, the amount of the death benefit (or the period of coverage) is adjusted on the basis of the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account, or

    * (C) in the case of funds held under a contract described in paragraph (2)(C), the amounts paid in, or the amounts paid out, reflect the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account.


* If a contract ceases to reflect current investment return and current market value, such contract shall not be considered as meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) after such cessation. Paragraph (3) shall be applied without regard to whether there is a guarantee, and obligations under such guarantee which exceed obligations under the contract without regard to such guarantee shall be accounted for as part of the company's general account.

#### (e) Pension plan contracts treated as paying annuity
* A pension plan contract which is not a life, accident, or health, property, casualty, or liability insurance contract shall be treated as a contract which provides for the payments of annuities for purposes of subsection (d).

#### (f) Other special rules
* #### (1) Life insurance reserves
  * For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(A) of section 816, the reflection of the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account shall be considered an assumed rate of interest.

* #### (2) Additional separate computations
  * Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such additional separate computations shall be made, with respect to the items separately accounted for in accordance with subsection (c), as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section and this part.

#### (g) Variable annuity contracts treated as annuity contracts
* For purposes of this part, the term "annuity contract" includes a contract which provides for the payment of a variable annuity computed on the basis of—

* #### (2) Safe harbor for diversification
  * A segregated asset account shall be treated as meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) for any quarter of a taxable year if as of the close of such quarter—

    * (A) it meets the requirements of section 851(b)(3), and

    * (B) no more than 55 percent of the value of the total assets of the account are assets described in section 851(b)(3)(A)(i).

* #### (3) Special rule for investments in United States obligations
  * To the extent that any segregated asset account with respect to a variable life insurance contract is invested in securities issued by the United States Treasury, the investments made by such account shall be treated as adequately diversified for purposes of paragraph (1).

  * For purposes of this subsection, if all of the beneficial interests in a regulated investment company or in a trust are held by 1 or more—

    * (A) insurance companies (or affiliated companies) in their general account or in segregated asset accounts, or

    * (B) fund managers (or affiliated companies) in connection with the creation or management of the regulated investment company or trust,

* #### (6) Government securities funds
  * In determining whether a segregated asset account is adequately diversified for purposes of paragraph (1), each United States Government agency or instrumentality shall be treated as a separate issuer.

#### (a) Computation of reserves
* In the case of a modified guaranteed contract, clause (ii) of section 807(e)(1)(A) shall not apply.

#### (b) Segregated assets under modified guaranteed contracts marked to market
* #### (1) In general
  * In the case of any life insurance company, for purposes of this subtitle—

    * (B) If any segregated asset is held by such company as of the close of any taxable year—

      * (i) such company shall recognize gain or loss as if such asset were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of such taxable year, and

      * (ii) any such gain or loss shall be taken into account for such taxable year.
