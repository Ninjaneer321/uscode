### PART VII—WASH SALES; STRADDLES

### §1091. Loss from wash sales of stock or securities
#### (a) Disallowance of loss deduction
* In the case of any loss claimed to have been sustained from any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities where it appears that, within a period beginning 30 days before the date of such sale or disposition and ending 30 days after such date, the taxpayer has acquired (by purchase or by an exchange on which the entire amount of gain or loss was recognized by law), or has entered into a contract or option so to acquire, substantially identical stock or securities, then no deduction shall be allowed under section 165 unless the taxpayer is a dealer in stock or securities and the loss is sustained in a transaction made in the ordinary course of such business. For purposes of this section, the term "stock or securities" shall, except as provided in regulations, include contracts or options to acquire or sell stock or securities.

#### (b) Stock acquired less than stock sold
* If the amount of stock or securities acquired (or covered by the contract or option to acquire) is less than the amount of stock or securities sold or otherwise disposed of, then the particular shares of stock or securities the loss from the sale or other disposition of which is not deductible shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

#### (c) Stock acquired not less than stock sold
* If the amount of stock or securities acquired (or covered by the contract or option to acquire) is not less than the amount of stock or securities sold or otherwise disposed of, then the particular shares of stock or securities the acquisition of which (or the contract or option to acquire which) resulted in the nondeductibility of the loss shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

#### (d) Unadjusted basis in case of wash sale of stock
* If the property consists of stock or securities the acquisition of which (or the contract or option to acquire which) resulted in the nondeductibility (under this section or corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws) of the loss from the sale or other disposition of substantially identical stock or securities, then the basis shall be the basis of the stock or securities so sold or disposed of, increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the difference, if any, between the price at which the property was acquired and the price at which such substantially identical stock or securities were sold or otherwise disposed of.

#### (e) Certain short sales of stock or securities and securities futures contracts to sell
* Rules similar to the rules of subsection (a) shall apply to any loss realized on the closing of a short sale of (or the sale, exchange, or termination of a securities futures contract to sell) stock or securities if, within a period beginning 30 days before the date of such closing and ending 30 days after such date—

  * (1) substantially identical stock or securities were sold, or

  * (2) another short sale of (or securities futures contracts to sell) substantially identical stock or securities was entered into.


* For purposes of this subsection, the term "securities futures contract" has the meaning provided by section 1234B(c).

#### (f) Cash settlement
* This section shall not fail to apply to a contract or option to acquire or sell stock or securities solely by reason of the fact that the contract or option settles in (or could be settled in) cash or property other than such stock or securities.

#### (a) Recognition of loss in case of straddles, etc.
* #### (1) Limitation on recognition of loss
  * #### (A) In general
    * Any loss with respect to 1 or more positions shall be taken into account for any taxable year only to the extent that the amount of such loss exceeds the unrecognized gain (if any) with respect to 1 or more positions which were offsetting positions with respect to 1 or more positions from which the loss arose.

  * #### (B) Carryover of loss
    * Any loss which may not be taken into account under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year shall, subject to the limitations under subparagraph (A), be treated as sustained in the succeeding taxable year.

  * #### (A) In general
    * In the case of any straddle which is an identified straddle—

      * (i) paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to positions comprising the identified straddle,

      * (ii) if there is any loss with respect to any position of the identified straddle, the basis of each of the offsetting positions in the identified straddle shall be increased by an amount which bears the same ratio to the loss as the unrecognized gain with respect to such offsetting position bears to the aggregate unrecognized gain with respect to all such offsetting positions,

      * (iii) if the application of clause (ii) does not result in an increase in the basis of any offsetting position in the identified straddle, the basis of each of the offsetting positions in the identified straddle shall be increased in a manner which—

        * (I) is reasonable, consistent with the purposes of this paragraph, and consistently applied by the taxpayer, and

        * (II) results in an aggregate increase in the basis of such offsetting positions which is equal to the loss described in clause (ii), and


      * (iv) any loss described in clause (ii) shall not otherwise be taken into account for purposes of this title.

  * #### (B) Identified straddle

        * (II) such time as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations.


      * (ii) to the extent provided by regulations, the value of each position of which (in the hands of the taxpayer immediately before the creation of the straddle) is not less than the basis of such position in the hands of the taxpayer at the time the straddle is created, and

      * (iii) which is not part of a larger straddle.


  * A straddle shall be treated as clearly identified for purposes of clause (i) only if such identification includes an identification of the positions in the straddle which are offsetting with respect to other positions in the straddle.

* #### (3) Unrecognized gain
  * For purposes of this subsection—

  * #### (A) In general
    * The term "unrecognized gain" means—

      * (ii) in the case of any position with respect to which, as of the close of the taxable year, gain has been realized but not recognized, the amount of gain so realized.

  * #### (B) Special rule for identified straddles
    * For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), the unrecognized gain with respect to any offsetting position shall be the excess of the fair market value of the position at the time of the determination over the fair market value of the position at the time the taxpayer identified the position as a position in an identified straddle.

  * #### (C) Reporting of gain
    * #### (i) In general
      * Each taxpayer shall disclose to the Secretary, at such time and in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations—

        * (II) to any position which, with respect to the taxpayer, is property described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1221(a) or to any position which is part of a hedging transaction (as defined in section 1256(e)), or

        * (III) with respect to any taxable year if no loss on a position (including a regulated futures contract) has been sustained during such taxable year or if the only loss sustained on such position is a loss described in subclause (II).

#### (b) Regulations
