* #### (2) Limitation
  * The basis to the distributee partner of property to which paragraph (1) is applicable shall not exceed the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.

#### (b) Distributions in liquidation
* The basis of property (other than money) distributed by a partnership to a partner in liquidation of the partner's interest shall be an amount equal to the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.

#### (c) Allocation of basis
* #### (1) In general
  * The basis of distributed properties to which subsection (a)(2) or (b) is applicable shall be allocated—

    * (A)(i) first to any unrealized receivables (as defined in section 751(c)) and inventory items (as defined in section 751(d)) in an amount equal to the adjusted basis of each such property to the partnership, and

    * (ii) if the basis to be allocated is less than the sum of the adjusted bases of such properties to the partnership, then, to the extent any decrease is required in order to have the adjusted bases of such properties equal the basis to be allocated, in the manner provided in paragraph (3), and

    * (B) to the extent of any basis remaining after the allocation under subparagraph (A), to other distributed properties—

      * (i) first by assigning to each such other property such other property's adjusted basis to the partnership, and

* #### (2) Method of allocating increase
  * Any increase required under paragraph (1)(B) shall be allocated among the properties—

    * (A) first to properties with unrealized appreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation before such increase (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized appreciation), and

    * (A) first to properties with unrealized depreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized depreciation before such decrease (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized depreciation), and

    * (B) then, to the extent such decrease is not allocated under subparagraph (A), in proportion to their respective adjusted bases (as adjusted under subparagraph (A)).

#### (d) Special partnership basis to transferee
* For purposes of subsections (a), (b), and (c), a partner who acquired all or a part of his interest by a transfer with respect to which the election provided in section 754 is not in effect, and to whom a distribution of property (other than money) is made with respect to the transferred interest within 2 years after such transfer, may elect, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to treat as the adjusted partnership basis of such property the adjusted basis such property would have if the adjustment provided in section 743(b) were in effect with respect to the partnership property. The Secretary may by regulations require the application of this subsection in the case of a distribution to a transferee partner, whether or not made within 2 years after the transfer, if at the time of the transfer the fair market value of the partnership property (other than money) exceeded 110 percent of its adjusted basis to the partnership.

#### (e) Exception

    * (B) the corporate partner has control of the distributed corporation immediately after the distribution or at any time thereafter, and

    * (C) the partnership's adjusted basis in such stock immediately before the distribution exceeded the corporate partner's adjusted basis in such stock immediately after the distribution,


* then an amount equal to such excess shall be applied to reduce (in accordance with subsection (c)) the basis of property held by the distributed corporation at such time (or, if the corporate partner does not control the distributed corporation at such time, at the time the corporate partner first has such control).

* #### (2) Exception for certain distributions before control acquired
  * Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any distribution of stock in the distributed corporation if—

    * (A) the corporate partner does not have control of such corporation immediately after such distribution, and

    * (B) the corporate partner establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such distribution was not part of a plan or arrangement to acquire control of the distributed corporation.

* #### (3) Limitations on basis reduction
  * #### (A) In general

  * #### (B) Reduction not to exceed adjusted basis of property
    * No reduction under paragraph (1) in the basis of any property shall exceed the adjusted basis of such property (determined without regard to such reduction).

* #### (4) Gain recognition where reduction limited
  * If the amount of any reduction under paragraph (1) (determined after the application of paragraph (3)(A)) exceeds the aggregate adjusted bases of the property of the distributed corporation—

* #### (7) Special rule for stock in controlled corporation
  * If the property held by a distributed corporation is stock in a corporation which the distributed corporation controls, this subsection shall be applied to reduce the basis of the property of such controlled corporation. This subsection shall be reapplied to any property of any controlled corporation which is stock in a corporation which it controls.

* #### (8) Regulations
  * The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection, including regulations to avoid double counting and to prevent the abuse of such purposes.

### §733. Basis of distributee partner's interest

  * (2) decrease the adjusted basis of partnership property by—

    * (A) the amount of any loss recognized to the distributee partner with respect to such distribution under section 731(a)(2), and

    * (B) in the case of distributed property to which section 732(b) applies, the excess of the basis of the distributed property to the distributee, as determined under section 732, over the adjusted basis of the distributed property to the partnership immediately before such distribution (as adjusted by section 732(d)).


* Paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply to any distributed property which is an interest in another partnership with respect to which the election provided in section 754 is not in effect.

### §736. Payments to a retiring partner or a deceased partner's successor in interest
#### (a) Payments considered as distributive share or guaranteed payment
* Payments made in liquidation of the interest of a retiring partner or a deceased partner shall, except as provided in subsection (b), be considered—

  * (1) as a distributive share to the recipient of partnership income if the amount thereof is determined with regard to the income of the partnership, or

  * (2) the net precontribution gain of the partner.

#### (b) Net precontribution gain
* For purposes of this section, the term "net precontribution gain" means the net gain (if any) which would have been recognized by the distributee partner under section 704(c)(1)(B) if all property which—

* had been distributed by such partnership to another partner.

#### (c) Basis rules
* #### (1) Partner's interest
  * The adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership shall be increased by the amount of any gain recognized by such partner under subsection (a). For purposes of determining the basis of the distributed property (other than money), such increase shall be treated as occurring immediately before the distribution.

* #### (2) Partnership's basis in contributed property
  * Appropriate adjustments shall be made to the adjusted basis of the partnership in the contributed property referred to in subsection (b) to reflect gain recognized under subsection (a).

* #### (2) Coordination with section 751
  * This section shall not apply to the extent section 751(b) applies to such distribution.
