### §532. Corporations subject to accumulated earnings tax
#### (a) General rule
* The accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531 shall apply to every corporation (other than those described in subsection (b)) formed or availed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders or the shareholders of any other corporation, by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.

#### (b) Exceptions
* The accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531 shall not apply to—

  * (1) a personal holding company (as defined in section 542),

  * (2) a corporation exempt from tax under subchapter F (section 501 and following), or

#### (c) Application determined without regard to number of shareholders
* The application of this part to a corporation shall be determined without regard to the number of shareholders of such corporation.

### §533. Evidence of purpose to avoid income tax
#### (a) Unreasonable accumulation determinative of purpose
* For purposes of section 532, the fact that the earnings and profits of a corporation are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business shall be determinative of the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders, unless the corporation by the preponderance of the evidence shall prove to the contrary.

#### (b) Holding or investment company
* The fact that any corporation is a mere holding or investment company shall be prima facie evidence of the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders.

### §534. Burden of proof
#### (a) General rule
* In any proceeding before the Tax Court involving a notice of deficiency based in whole or in part on the allegation that all or any part of the earnings and profits have been permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business, the burden of proof with respect to such allegation shall—

  * (1) if notification has not been sent in accordance with subsection (b), be on the Secretary, or

* Within such time (but not less than 30 days) after the mailing of the notification described in subsection (b) as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations, the taxpayer may submit a statement of the grounds (together with facts sufficient to show the basis thereof) on which the taxpayer relies to establish that all or any part of the earnings and profits have not been permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business.

#### (d) Jeopardy assessment
* If pursuant to section 6861(a) a jeopardy assessment is made before the mailing of the notice of deficiency referred to in subsection (a), for purposes of this section such notice of deficiency shall, to the extent that it informs the taxpayer that such deficiency includes the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, constitute the notification described in subsection (b), and in that event the statement described in subsection (c) may be included in the taxpayer's petition to the Tax Court.
