  * (1) subsection (b)(2) shall apply first to substantially identical assets acquired for arbitrage operations held at the close of business on the day such sale is made, and only to the extent that the quantity sold short exceeds the substantially identical assets acquired for arbitrage operations held at the close of business on the day such sale is made, shall the holding period of any other such identical assets held by the taxpayer be affected;

  * (2) in the event that assets acquired for arbitrage operations are disposed of in such manner as to create a net short position in assets acquired for arbitrage operations, such net short position shall be deemed to constitute a short sale made on that day;

  * (3) for the purpose of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection the taxpayer will be deemed as of the close of any business day to hold property which he is or will be entitled to receive or acquire by virtue of any other asset acquired for arbitrage operations or by virtue of any contract he has entered into in an arbitrage operation; and

  * (4) for the purpose of this subsection arbitrage operations are transactions involving the purchase and sale of assets for the purpose of profiting from a current difference between the price of the asset purchased and the price of the asset sold, and in which the asset purchased, if not identical to the asset sold, is such that by virtue thereof the taxpayer is, or will be, entitled to acquire assets identical to the assets sold.

* For purposes of this section—

* #### (1) In general
  * The taxpayer shall be treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction with respect to any financial asset if the taxpayer—

    * (A) holds a long position under a notional principal contract with respect to the financial asset,

    * (B) enters into a forward or futures contract to acquire the financial asset,

    * (C) is the holder of a call option, and is the grantor of a put option, with respect to the financial asset and such options have substantially equal strike prices and substantially contemporaneous maturity dates, or

    * (D) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, enters into one or more other transactions (or acquires one or more positions) that have substantially the same effect as a transaction described in any of the preceding subparagraphs.

* #### (2) Exception for positions which are marked to market
  * This section shall not apply to any constructive ownership transaction if all of the positions which are part of such transaction are marked to market under any provision of this title or the regulations thereunder.

* #### (3) Long position under notional principal contract
  * A person shall be treated as holding a long position under a notional principal contract with respect to any financial asset if such person—

    * (A) has the right to be paid (or receive credit for) all or substantially all of the investment yield (including appreciation) on such financial asset for a specified period, and

    * (B) is obligated to reimburse (or provide credit for) all or substantially all of any decline in the value of such financial asset.

* #### (4) Forward contract
  * The term "forward contract" means any contract to acquire in the future (or provide or receive credit for the future value of) any financial asset.

#### (e) Net underlying long-term capital gain
* For purposes of this section, in the case of any constructive ownership transaction with respect to any financial asset, the term "net underlying long-term capital gain" means the aggregate net capital gain that the taxpayer would have had if—

  * (1) the financial asset had been acquired for fair market value on the date such transaction was opened and sold for fair market value on the date such transaction was closed, and

  * (2) only gains and losses that would have resulted from the deemed ownership under paragraph (1) were taken into account.


* The amount of the net underlying long-term capital gain with respect to any financial asset shall be treated as zero unless the amount thereof is established by clear and convincing evidence.

#### (f) Special rule where taxpayer takes delivery
* Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if a constructive ownership transaction is closed by reason of taking delivery, this section shall be applied as if the taxpayer had sold all the contracts, options, or other positions which are part of such transaction for fair market value on the closing date. The amount of gain recognized under the preceding sentence shall not exceed the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under subsection (a). Proper adjustments shall be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain recognized and treated as ordinary income under this subsection.

#### (g) Regulations
* The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section, including regulations—

  * (1) to permit taxpayers to mark to market constructive ownership transactions in lieu of applying this section, and

  * (2) to exclude certain forward contracts which do not convey substantially all of the economic return with respect to a financial asset.
