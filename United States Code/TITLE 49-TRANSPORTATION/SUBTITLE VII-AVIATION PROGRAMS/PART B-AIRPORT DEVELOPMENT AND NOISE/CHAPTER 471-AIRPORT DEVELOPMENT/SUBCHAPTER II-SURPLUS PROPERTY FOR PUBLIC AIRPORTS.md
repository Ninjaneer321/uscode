### §47151. Authority to transfer an interest in surplus property
* (a) GENERAL AUTHORITY.—Subject to sections 47152 and 47153 of this title, a department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive branch of the United States Government or a wholly owned Government corporation may convey to a State, political subdivision of a State, or tax-supported organization any interest in surplus property—

  * (1) that the Secretary of Transportation decides is—

    * (A) desirable for developing, improving, operating, or maintaining a public airport (as defined in section 47102 of this title);

    * (B) reasonably necessary to fulfill the immediate and foreseeable future requirements for developing, improving, operating, or maintaining a public airport; or

    * (C) needed for developing sources of revenue from nonaviation businesses at a public airport; and


  * (2) if the Administrator of General Services approves the conveyance and decides the interest is not best suited for industrial use.


* (b) ENSURING COMPLIANCE.—Only the Secretary may ensure compliance with an instrument conveying an interest in surplus property under this subchapter. The Secretary may amend the instrument to correct the instrument or to make the conveyance comply with law.

* (c) DISPOSING OF INTERESTS NOT CONVEYED UNDER THIS SUBCHAPTER.—An interest in surplus property that could be used at a public airport but that is not conveyed under this subchapter shall be disposed of under other applicable law.

* (d) WAIVER OF CONDITION.—Before the Secretary may waive any condition imposed on an interest in surplus property conveyed under subsection (a) that such interest be used for an aeronautical purpose, the Secretary must provide notice to the public not less than 30 days before waiving such condition.

* (e) REQUESTS BY PUBLIC AGENCIES.—Except with respect to a request made by another department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive branch of the United States Government, such a department, agency, or instrumentality shall give priority consideration to a request made by a public agency (as defined in section 47102) for surplus property described in subsection (a) for use at a public airport.

### §47152. Terms of conveyances
* Except as provided in section 47153 of this title, the following terms apply to a conveyance of an interest in surplus property under this subchapter:

  * (1) A State, political subdivision of a State, or tax-supported organization receiving the interest may use, lease, salvage, or dispose of the interest for other than airport purposes only after the Secretary of Transportation gives written consent that the interest can be used, leased, salvaged, or disposed of without materially and adversely affecting the development, improvement, operation, or maintenance of the airport at which the property is located.

  * (2) The interest shall be used and maintained for public use and benefit without unreasonable discrimination.

  * (3) A right may not be vested in a person, excluding others in the same class from using the airport at which the property is located—

    * (A) to conduct an aeronautical activity requiring the operation of aircraft; or

    * (B) to engage in selling or supplying aircraft, aircraft accessories, equipment, or supplies (except gasoline and oil), or aircraft services necessary to operate aircraft (including maintaining and repairing aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, and appliances).


  * (4) The State, political subdivision, or tax-supported organization accepting the interest shall clear and protect the aerial approaches to the airport by mitigating existing, and preventing future, airport hazards.

  * (5) During a national emergency declared by the President or Congress, the United States Government is entitled to use, control, or possess, without charge, any part of the public airport at which the property is located. However, the Government shall—

    * (A) pay the entire cost of maintaining the part of the airport it exclusively uses, controls, or possesses during the emergency;

    * (B) contribute a reasonable share, consistent with the Government's use, of the cost of maintaining the property it uses nonexclusively, or over which the Government has nonexclusive control or possession, during the emergency; and

    * (C) pay a fair rental for use, control, or possession of improvements to the airport made without Government assistance.


  * (6) The Government is entitled to the nonexclusive use, without charge, of the landing area of an airport at which the property is located. The Secretary may limit the use of the landing area if necessary to prevent unreasonable interference with use by other authorized aircraft. However, the Government shall—

    * (A) contribute a reasonable share, consistent with the Government's use, of the cost of maintaining and operating the landing area; and

    * (B) pay for damages caused by its use of the landing area if its use of the landing area is substantial.


  * (7) The State, political subdivision, or tax-supported organization accepting the interest shall release the Government from all liability for damages arising under an agreement that provides for Government use of any part of an airport owned, controlled, or operated by the State, political subdivision, or tax-supported organization on which, adjacent to which, or in connection with which, the property is located.

  * (8) When a term under this section is not satisfied, any part of the interest in the property reverts to the Government, at the option of the Government, as the property then exists.

### §47153. Waiving and adding terms
* (a) GENERAL AUTHORITY.—(1) The Secretary of Transportation may waive, without charge, a term of a conveyance of an interest in property under this subchapter if the Secretary decides that—

  * (A) the property no longer serves the purpose for which it was conveyed; or

  * (B) the waiver will not prevent carrying out the purpose for which the conveyance was made and is necessary to advance the civil aviation interests of the United States.


* (2) The Secretary of Transportation shall waive a term under paragraph (1) of this subsection on terms the Secretary considers necessary to protect or advance the civil aviation interests of the United States.

* (b) WAIVERS AND INCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL TERMS ON REQUEST.—On request of the Secretary of Transportation or the Secretary of a military department, a department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive branch of the United States Government or a wholly owned Government corporation may waive a term required by section 47152 of this title or add another term if the appropriate Secretary decides it is necessary to protect or advance the interests of the United States in civil aviation or for national defense.

* (c) PUBLIC NOTICE BEFORE WAIVER.—Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), before the Secretary may waive any term imposed under this section that an interest in land be used for an aeronautical purpose, the Secretary must provide notice to the public not less than 30 days before waiving such term.
