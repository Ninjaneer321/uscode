### SUBCHAPTER I—NOISE ABATEMENT

### §47501. Definitions
* In this subchapter—

  * (1) "airport" means a public-use airport as defined in section 47102 of this title.

  * (2) "airport operator" means—

    * (A) for an airport serving air carriers that have certificates from the Secretary of Transportation, any person holding an airport operating certificate issued under section 44706 of this title; and

    * (B) for any other airport, the person operating the airport.

### §47502. Noise measurement and exposure systems and identifying land use compatible with noise exposure
* After consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and United States Government, State, and interstate agencies that the Secretary of Transportation considers appropriate, the Secretary shall by regulation—

  * (1) establish a single system of measuring noise that—

    * (A) has a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reactions of individuals to noise; and

    * (B) is applied uniformly in measuring noise at airports and the surrounding area;


  * (2) establish a single system for determining the exposure of individuals to noise resulting from airport operations, including noise intensity, duration, frequency, and time of occurrence; and

  * (3) identify land uses normally compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise.

### §47503. Noise exposure maps
* (a) SUBMISSION AND PREPARATION.—An airport operator may submit to the Secretary of Transportation a noise exposure map showing the noncompatible uses in each area of the map on the date the map is submitted, a description of estimated aircraft operations during a forecast period that is at least 5 years in the future and how those operations will affect the map. The map shall—

  * (1) be prepared in consultation with public agencies and planning authorities in the area surrounding the airport; and

  * (2) comply with regulations prescribed under section 47502 of this title.


* (b) REVISED MAPS.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—An airport operator that submits a noise exposure map under subsection (a) shall submit a revised map to the Secretary if, in an area surrounding an airport, a change in the operation of the airport would establish a substantial new noncompatible use, or would significantly reduce noise over existing noncompatible uses, that is not reflected in either the existing conditions map or forecast map currently on file with the Federal Aviation Administration.

  * (2) TIMING.—A submission under paragraph (1) shall be required only if the relevant change in the operation of the airport occurs during—

    * (A) the forecast period of the applicable noise exposure map submitted by an airport operator under subsection (a); or

    * (B) the implementation period of the airport operator's noise compatibility program.

### §47504. Noise compatibility programs
* (a) SUBMISSIONS.—(1) An airport operator that submitted a noise exposure map and related information under section 47503(a) of this title may submit a noise compatibility program to the Secretary of Transportation after—

  * (A) consulting with public agencies and planning authorities in the area surrounding the airport, United States Government officials having local responsibility for the airport, and air carriers using the airport; and

  * (B) notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.


* (2) A program submitted under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall state the measures the operator has taken or proposes to take to reduce existing noncompatible uses and prevent introducing additional noncompatible uses in the area covered by the map. The measures may include—

  * (A) establishing a preferential runway system;

  * (B) restricting the use of the airport by a type or class of aircraft because of the noise characteristics of the aircraft;

  * (C) constructing barriers and acoustical shielding and soundproofing public buildings;

  * (D) using flight procedures to control the operation of aircraft to reduce exposure of individuals to noise in the area surrounding the airport; and

  * (E) acquiring land, air rights, easements, development rights, and other interests to ensure that the property will be used in ways compatible with airport operations.

The Secretary shall approve the program (except as the program is related to flight procedures referred to in subsection (a)(2)(D)) if the program—

  * (A) does not place an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign commerce;

  * (B) is reasonably consistent with achieving the goal of reducing noncompatible uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible uses; and

  * (C) provides for necessary revisions because of a revised map submitted under section 47503(b) of this title.


* (2) A program (except as the program is related to flight procedures referred to in subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section) is deemed to be approved if the Secretary does not act within the 180-day period.

* (3) The Secretary shall submit any part of a program related to flight procedures referred to in subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. The Administrator shall approve or disapprove that part of the program.
