### SUBCHAPTER II—NATIONAL AVIATION NOISE POLICY

### §47521. Findings
* Congress finds that—

  * (1) aviation noise management is crucial to the continued increase in airport capacity;

  * (2) community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsistent restrictions on aviation that could impede the national air transportation system;

  * (3) a noise policy must be carried out at the national level;

  * (4) local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered in determining the national interest;

  * (5) community concerns can be alleviated through the use of new technology aircraft and the use of revenues, including those available from passenger facility charges, for noise management;

  * (6) revenues controlled by the United States Government can help resolve noise problems and carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system;

  * (7) revenues derived from a passenger facility charge may be applied to noise management and increased airport capacity; and

  * (8) a precondition to the establishment and collection of a passenger facility charge is the prescribing by the Secretary of Transportation of a regulation establishing procedures for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on operations of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft.

### §47522. Definitions
* In this subchapter—

  * (1) "air carrier", "air transportation", and "United States" have the same meanings given those terms in section 40102(a) of this title.

  * (2) "stage 3 noise levels" means the stage 3 noise levels in part 36 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, in effect on November 5, 1990.

### §47523. National aviation noise policy
* (a) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.—Not later than July 1, 1991, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish by regulation a national aviation noise policy that considers this subchapter, including the phaseout and nonaddition of stage 2 aircraft as provided in this subchapter and dates for carrying out that policy and reporting requirements consistent with this subchapter and law existing as of November 5, 1990.

* (b) DETAILED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS.—The policy shall be based on a detailed economic analysis of the impact of the phaseout date for stage 2 aircraft on competition in the airline industry, including—

  * (1) the ability of air carriers to achieve capacity growth consistent with the projected rate of growth for the airline industry;

  * (2) the impact of competition in the airline and air cargo industries;

  * (3) the impact on nonhub and small community air service; and

  * (4) the impact on new entry into the airline industry.

### §47524. Airport noise and access restriction review program
* (a) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.—The national aviation noise policy established under section 47523 of this title shall provide for establishing by regulation a national program for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on the operation of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft. The program shall provide for adequate public notice and opportunity for comment on the restrictions.

* (b) STAGE 2 AIRCRAFT.—Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, an airport noise or access restriction may include a restriction on the operation of stage 2 aircraft proposed after October 1, 1990, only if the airport operator publishes the proposed restriction and prepares and makes available for public comment at least 180 days before the effective date of the proposed restriction—

  * (1) an analysis of the anticipated or actual costs and benefits of the existing or proposed restriction;

  * (2) a description of alternative restrictions;

  * (3) a description of the alternative measures considered that do not involve aircraft restrictions; and

  * (4) a comparison of the costs and benefits of the alternative measures to the costs and benefits of the proposed restriction.


* (c) STAGE 3 AIRCRAFT.—(1) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of stage 3 aircraft not in effect on October 1, 1990, may become effective only if the restriction has been agreed to by the airport proprietor and all aircraft operators or has been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of Transportation after an airport or aircraft operator's request for approval as provided by the program established under this section. Restrictions to which this paragraph applies include—

  * (A) a restriction on noise levels generated on either a single event or cumulative basis;

  * (B) a restriction on the total number of stage 3 aircraft operations;

  * (C) a noise budget or noise allocation program that would include stage 3 aircraft;

  * (D) a restriction on hours of operations; and

  * (E) any other restriction on stage 3 aircraft.


* (2) Not later than 180 days after the Secretary receives an airport or aircraft operator's request for approval of an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of a stage 3 aircraft, the Secretary shall approve or disapprove the restriction. The Secretary may approve the restriction only if the Secretary finds on the basis of substantial evidence that—

  * (A) the restriction is reasonable, nonarbitrary, and nondiscriminatory;

  * (B) the restriction does not create an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign commerce;

  * (C) the restriction is not inconsistent with maintaining the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace;

  * (D) the restriction does not conflict with a law or regulation of the United States;

  * (E) an adequate opportunity has been provided for public comment on the restriction; and

  * (F) the restriction does not create an unreasonable burden on the national aviation system.


* (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection do not apply if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, before November 5, 1990, has formed a working group (outside the process established by part 150 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations) with a local airport operator to examine the noise impact of air traffic control procedure changes at the airport. However, if an agreement on noise reductions at that airport is made between the airport proprietor and one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers that constitute a majority of the carrier use of the airport, this paragraph applies only to a local action to enforce the agreement.

* (4) The Secretary may reevaluate an airport noise or access restriction previously agreed to or approved under this subsection on request of an aircraft operator able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there has been a change in the noise environment of the affected airport that justifies a reevaluation. The Secretary shall establish by regulation procedures for conducting a reevaluation. A reevaluation—

  * (A) shall be based on the criteria in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and

  * (B) may be conducted only after 2 years after a decision under paragraph (2) of this subsection has been made.


* (d) NONAPPLICATION.—Subsections (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to—

  * (1) a local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport noise or access agreement between the airport operator and the aircraft operators in effect on November 5, 1990;

  * (2) a local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport noise or access restriction agreed to by the airport operator and the aircraft operators before November 5, 1990;

  * (3) an intergovernmental agreement including an airport noise or access restriction in effect on November 5, 1990;

  * (4) a subsequent amendment to an airport noise or access agreement or restriction in effect on November 5, 1990, that does not reduce or limit aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety;

  * (5)(A) an airport noise or access restriction adopted by an airport operator not later than October 1, 1990, and stayed as of October 1, 1990, by a court order or as a result of litigation, if any part of the restriction is subsequently allowed by a court to take effect; or

  * (B) a new restriction imposed by an airport operator to replace any part of a restriction described in subclause (A) of this clause that is disallowed by a court, if the new restriction would not prohibit aircraft operations in effect on November 5, 1990; or

  * (6) a local action that represents the adoption of the final part of a program of a staged airport noise or access restriction if the initial part of the program was adopted during 1988 and was in effect on November 5, 1990.


* (e) GRANT LIMITATIONS.—Beginning on the 91st day after the Secretary prescribes a regulation under subsection (a) of this section, a sponsor of a facility operating under an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of stage 3 aircraft that first became effective after October 1, 1990, is eligible for a grant under section 47104 of this title and is eligible to impose a passenger facility charge under section 40117 of this title only if the restriction has been—

  * (1) agreed to by the airport proprietor and aircraft operators;

  * (2) approved by the Secretary as required by subsection (c)(1) of this section; or

  * (3) rescinded.

### §47525. Decision about airport noise and access restrictions on certain stage 2 aircraft
* The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct a study and decide on the application of section 47524(a)–(d) of this title to airport noise and access restrictions on the operation of stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of not more than 75,000 pounds. In making the decision, the Secretary shall consider—

  * (1) noise levels produced by those aircraft relative to other aircraft;

  * (2) the benefits to general aviation and the need for efficiency in the national air transportation system;

  * (3) the differences in the nature of operations at airports and the areas immediately surrounding the airports;

  * (4) international standards and agreements on aircraft noise; and

  * (5) other factors the Secretary considers necessary.

### §47526. Limitations for noncomplying airport noise and access restrictions
* Unless the Secretary of Transportation is satisfied that an airport is not imposing an airport noise or access restriction not in compliance with this subchapter, the airport may not—

  * (1) receive money under subchapter I of chapter 471 of this title; or

  * (2) impose a passenger facility charge under section 40117 of this title.

### §47527. Liability of the United States Government for noise damages
* When a proposed airport noise or access restriction is disapproved under this subchapter, the United States Government shall assume liability for noise damages only to the extent that a taking has occurred as a direct result of the disapproval. The United States Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction of a civil action under this section.

### §47528. Prohibition on operating certain aircraft not complying with stage 3 noise levels
* (a) PROHIBITION.—Except as provided in subsection (b) or (f) of this section and section 47530 of this title, a person may operate after December 31, 1999, a civil subsonic turbojet (for which an airworthiness certificate other than an experimental certificate has been issued by the Administrator) with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds to or from an airport in the United States only if the Secretary of Transportation finds that the aircraft complies with the stage 3 noise levels.

* (b) WAIVERS.—(1) If, not later than July 1, 1999, at least 85 percent of the aircraft used by an air carrier or foreign air carrier to provide air transportation comply with the stage 3 noise levels, the carrier may apply for a waiver of subsection (a) of this section for the remaining aircraft used by the carrier to provide air transportation. The application must be filed with the Secretary not later than January 1, 1999, or, in the case of a foreign air carrier, the 15th day following the date of the enactment of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century and must include a plan with firm orders for making all aircraft used by the carrier to provide air transportation comply with the noise levels not later than December 31, 2003.

* (2) The Secretary may grant a waiver under this subsection if the Secretary finds it would be in the public interest. In making the finding, the Secretary shall consider the effect of granting the waiver on competition in the air carrier industry and on small community air service.

* (3) A waiver granted under this subsection may not permit the operation of stage 2 aircraft in the United States after December 31, 2003.
