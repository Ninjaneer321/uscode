      * (i) received essential air service for which compensation was provided to an air carrier under this subchapter; or

      * (ii) received a 90-day notice of intent to terminate essential air service and the Secretary required the air carrier to continue to provide such service to the community.


  * (2) "enhanced essential air service" means scheduled air transportation to an eligible place of a higher level or quality than basic essential air service described in section 41732 of this title.


* (b) LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO DECIDE A PLACE NOT AN ELIGIBLE PLACE.—The Secretary may not decide that a place described in subsection (a)(1) of this section is not an eligible place on any basis that is not specifically stated in this subchapter.

* (f) DEFINITION.—For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(B), the term "enplanements" means the number of passengers enplaning, at an eligible place, on flights operated by the subsidized essential air service carrier.

### §41732. Basic essential air service
* (a) GENERAL.—Basic essential air service provided under section 41733 of this title is scheduled air transportation of passengers and cargo—

  * (1) to a hub airport that has convenient connecting or single-plane air service to a substantial number of destinations beyond that airport; or

  * (2) to a small hub or nonhub airport, when in Alaska or when the nearest hub airport is more than 400 miles from an eligible place.


* (b) MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.—Basic essential air service shall include at least the following:

  * (1)(A) for a place not in Alaska, 2 daily round trips 6 days a week, with not more than one intermediate stop on each flight; or

  * (B) for a place in Alaska, a level of service at least equal to that provided in 1976 or 2 round trips a week, whichever is greater, except that the Secretary of Transportation and the appropriate State authority of Alaska may agree to a different level of service after consulting with the affected community.

  * (2) flights at reasonable times considering the needs of passengers with connecting flights at the airport and at prices that are not excessive compared to the generally prevailing prices of other air carriers for like service between similar places.

  * (3) for a place not in Alaska, service provided in an aircraft with an effective capacity of at least 15 passengers if the average daily boardings at the place in any calendar year from 1976-1986 were more than 11 passengers unless—

    * (A) that level-of-service requirement would require paying compensation in a fiscal year under section 41733(d) or 41734(d) or (e) of this title for the place when compensation otherwise would not have been paid for that place in that year; or

    * (B) the affected community agrees with the Secretary in writing to the use of smaller aircraft to provide service to the place.


  * (4) service accommodating the estimated passenger and property traffic at an average load factor, for each class of traffic considering seasonal demands for the service, of not more than—

    * (A) 50 percent; or

    * (B) 60 percent when service is provided by aircraft with more than 14 passenger seats.


  * (5) service provided in aircraft with at least 2 engines and using 2 pilots, unless scheduled air transportation has not been provided to the place in aircraft with at least 2 engines and using 2 pilots for at least 60 consecutive operating days at any time since October 31, 1978.

A waiver issued under this subsection shall remain in effect for a limited period of time, as determined by the Secretary.

### §41733. Level of basic essential air service
* (a) DECISIONS MADE BEFORE OCTOBER 1, 1988.—For each eligible place for which a decision was made before October 1, 1988, under section 419 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, establishing the level of essential air transportation, the level of basic essential air service for that place shall be the level established by the Secretary of Transportation for that place by not later than December 29, 1988.

* (b) DECISIONS NOT MADE BEFORE OCTOBER 1, 1988.—(1) The Secretary shall decide on the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place for which a decision was not made before October 1, 1988, establishing the level of essential air transportation, when the Secretary receives notice that service to that place will be provided by only one air carrier. The Secretary shall make the decision by the last day of the 6-month period beginning on the date the Secretary receives the notice. The Secretary may impose notice requirements necessary to carry out this subsection. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located.

* (2) Until the Secretary has made a decision on a level of basic essential air service for an eligible place under this subsection, the Secretary, on petition by an appropriate representative of the place, shall prohibit an air carrier from ending, suspending, or reducing air transportation to that place that appears to deprive the place of basic essential air service.

* (c) AVAILABILITY OF COMPENSATION.—(1) If the Secretary decides that basic essential air service will not be provided to an eligible place without compensation, the Secretary shall provide notice that an air carrier may apply to provide basic essential air service to the place for compensation under this section. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors—

  * (A) the demonstrated reliability of the applicant in providing scheduled air service;

  * (B) the contractual and marketing arrangements the applicant has made with a larger carrier to ensure service beyond the hub airport;

  * (C) the interline arrangements that the applicant has made with a larger carrier to allow passengers and cargo of the applicant at the hub airport to be transported by the larger carrier through one reservation, ticket, and baggage check-in;

  * (D) the preferences of the actual and potential users of air transportation at the eligible place, giving substantial weight to the views of the elected officials representing the users;

  * (E) whether the air carrier has included a plan in its proposal to market its services to the community; and

  * (F) for an eligible place in Alaska, the experience of the applicant in providing, in Alaska, scheduled air service, or significant patterns of non-scheduled air service under an exemption granted under section 40109(a) and (c)–(h) of this title.


* (2) Under guidelines prescribed under section 41737(a) of this title, the Secretary shall pay the rate of compensation for providing basic essential air service under this section and section 41734 of this title.

* (d) COMPENSATION PAYMENTS.—The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section at times and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall end payment of compensation to an air carrier for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place when the Secretary decides the compensation is no longer necessary to maintain basic essential air service to the place.

* (e) REVIEW.—The Secretary shall review periodically the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place. Based on the review and consultations with an interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of service, to the extent such adjustments are to a level not less than the basic essential air service level established under subsection (a) for the airport that serves the community.

* (f) NOTICE TO COMMUNITIES PRIOR TO TERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall notify each community receiving basic essential air service for which compensation is being paid under this subchapter on or before the 45th day before issuing any final decision to end the payment of such compensation due to a determination by the Secretary that providing such service requires a rate of subsidy per passenger in excess of the subsidy cap.

  * (2) PROCEDURES TO AVOID TERMINATION.—The Secretary shall establish, by order, procedures by which each community notified of an impending loss of subsidy under paragraph (1) may work directly with an air carrier to ensure that the air carrier is able to submit a proposal to the Secretary to provide essential air service to such community for an amount of compensation that would not exceed the subsidy cap.

  * (3) ASSISTANCE PROVIDED.—The Secretary shall provide, by order, information to each community notified under paragraph (1) regarding—

    * (A) the procedures established pursuant to paragraph (2); and

    * (B) the maximum amount of compensation that could be provided under this subchapter to an air carrier serving such community that would comply with basic essential air service and the subsidy cap.


* (g) PROPOSALS OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RESTORE ELIGIBILITY.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—If the Secretary, after the date of enactment of this subsection, ends payment of compensation to an air carrier for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place because the Secretary has determined that providing such service requires a rate of subsidy per passenger in excess of the subsidy cap or that the place is no longer an eligible place pursuant to section 41731(a)(1)(B), a State or local government may submit to the Secretary a proposal for restoring compensation for such service. Such proposal shall be a joint proposal of the State or local government and an air carrier.

  * (2) DETERMINATION BY SECRETARY.—The Secretary shall issue an order restoring the eligibility of the otherwise eligible place to receive basic essential air service by an air carrier for compensation under subsection (c) if—

    * (A) a State or local government submits to the Secretary a proposal under paragraph (1); and

    * (B) the Secretary determines that—

      * (i) the rate of subsidy per passenger under the proposal does not exceed the subsidy cap;

      * (ii) the proposal is likely to result in an average number of enplanements per day that will satisfy the requirement in section 41731(a)(1)(B); and

      * (iii) the proposal is consistent with the legal and regulatory requirements of the essential air service program.


* (h) SUBSIDY CAP DEFINED.—In this section, the term "subsidy cap" means the subsidy-per-passenger cap established by section 332 of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 (Public Law 106–69; 113 Stat. 1022).

### §41734. Ending, suspending, and reducing basic essential air service
* (a) NOTICE REQUIRED.—An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days' notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.

* (b) CONTINUATION OF SERVICE FOR 30 DAYS AFTER NOTICE PERIOD.—If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an additional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.

* (c) CONTINUATION OF SERVICE FOR ADDITIONAL 30-DAY PERIODS.—If at the end of the 30-day period under subsection (b) of this section the Secretary decides another air carrier will not provide basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing service to continue to provide service for additional 30-day periods until another carrier begins providing service on a continuing basis. At the end of each 30-day period, the Secretary shall decide if another carrier will provide service on a continuing basis.

* (d) CONTINUATION OF COMPENSATION AFTER NOTICE PERIOD.—If an air carrier receiving compensation under section 41733 of this title for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place is required to continue to provide service to the place under this section after the 90-day notice period under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide the carrier with compensation sufficient—

  * (1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and

  * (2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.


* (e) COMPENSATION TO AIR CARRIERS ORIGINALLY PROVIDING SERVICE WITHOUT COMPENSATION.—If the Secretary requires an air carrier providing basic essential air service to an eligible place without compensation under section 41733 of this title to continue providing that service after the 90-day notice period required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide the carrier with compensation after the end of the 90-day notice period that is sufficient—

  * (1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and

  * (2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.


* (f) FINDING REPLACEMENT CARRIERS.—When the Secretary requires an air carrier to continue to provide basic essential air service to an eligible place, the Secretary shall continue to make every effort to find another carrier to provide at least that basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis.

* (g) TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY.—If an air carrier, providing basic essential air service under section 41733 of this title between an eligible place and an airport at which the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration limits the number of instrument flight rule takeoffs and landings of aircraft, provides notice under subsection (a) of this section of an intention to end, suspend, or reduce that service and another carrier is found to provide the service, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to transfer any operational authority the carrier has to land or take off at that airport related to the service to the eligible place to the carrier that will provide the service, if—

  * (1) the carrier that will provide the service needs the authority; and

  * (2) the authority to be transferred is being used to provide air service to another eligible place.


* (h) NONCONSIDERATION OF SLOT AVAILABILITY.—In determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, the Secretary shall not consider as a factor whether slots at a high density airport are available for providing such service.

* (i) EXEMPTION FROM HOLD-IN REQUIREMENTS.—If, after the date of enactment of this subsection, an air carrier commences air transportation to an eligible place that is not receiving scheduled passenger air service as a result of the failure of the eligible place to meet requirements contained in an appropriations Act, the air carrier shall not be subject to the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) with respect to such air transportation.

### §41735. Enhanced essential air service
* (a) PROPOSALS.—(1) A State or local government may submit a proposal to the Secretary of Transportation for enhanced essential air service to an eligible place for which basic essential air service is being provided under section 41733 of this title. The proposal shall—

* (3) For service for which the Government pays 100 percent of the compensation, based on the review and consultation with the State or local government submitting the proposal, the Secretary shall decide whether the service has succeeded for at least a 2-year period under the criteria prescribed under subsection (a)(3) of this section. If unsuccessful, the place is not eligible for air service or air transportation for which compensation is paid by the Secretary under this subchapter.

* (e) ENDING, SUSPENDING, AND REDUCING AIR TRANSPORTATION.—An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of enhanced essential air service established for that place by the Secretary under this section only after giving the Secretary, the affected community, and the State or local government or person paying compensation for that service at least 30 days' notice before ending, suspending, or reducing the service.
