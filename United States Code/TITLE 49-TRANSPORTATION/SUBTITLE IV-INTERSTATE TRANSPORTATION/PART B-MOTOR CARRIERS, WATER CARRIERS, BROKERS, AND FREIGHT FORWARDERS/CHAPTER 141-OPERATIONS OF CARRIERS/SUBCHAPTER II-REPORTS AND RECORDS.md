  * (1) FROM FILING.—The Secretary may exempt upon good cause shown any party from the financial reporting requirements of subsection (a). Any request for such exemption must demonstrate, at a minimum, that an exemption is required to avoid competitive harm and preserve confidential business information that is not otherwise publicly available.

  * (3) PERIOD OF EXEMPTIONS.—Exemptions granted under this subsection shall be for 3-year periods.
