* (b) RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING.—The Secretary shall require, by regulation, that any arrangement, between a motor carrier of property providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 and any other person, under which such other person is to provide any portion of such transportation by a motor vehicle not owned by the carrier shall specify, in writing, who is responsible for loading and unloading the property onto and from the motor vehicle.

### §14103. Loading and unloading motor vehicles
* (a) SHIPPER RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSISTING.—Whenever a shipper or receiver of property requires that any person who owns or operates a motor vehicle transporting property in interstate commerce (whether or not such transportation is subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135) be assisted in the loading or unloading of such vehicle, the shipper or receiver shall be responsible for providing such assistance or shall compensate the owner or operator for all costs associated with securing and compensating the person or persons providing such assistance.

* (b) COERCION PROHIBITED.—It shall be unlawful to coerce or attempt to coerce any person providing transportation of property by motor vehicle for compensation in interstate commerce (whether or not such transportation is subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135) to load or unload any part of such property onto or from such vehicle or to employ or pay one or more persons to load or unload any part of such property onto or from such vehicle; except that this subsection shall not be construed as making unlawful any activity which is not unlawful under the National Labor Relations Act or the Act of March 23, 1932 (47 Stat. 70; 29 U.S.C. 101 et seq.), commonly known as the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

### §14104. Household goods carrier operations
* (a) GENERAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY.—

  * (1) PAPERWORK MINIMIZATION.—The Secretary may issue regulations, including regulations protecting individual shippers, in order to carry out this part with respect to the transportation of household goods by motor carriers subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135. The regulations and paperwork required of motor carriers providing transportation of household goods shall be minimized to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the protection of individual shippers.

  * (2) PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—Regulations of the Secretary protecting individual shippers shall include, where appropriate, reasonable performance standards for the transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135.

    * (B) FACTORS TO CONSIDER.—In establishing performance standards under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account at least the following—

      * (i) the level of performance that can be achieved by a well-managed motor carrier transporting household goods;

      * (ii) the degree of harm to individual shippers which could result from a violation of the regulation;

      * (iii) the need to set the level of performance at a level sufficient to deter abuses which result in harm to consumers and violations of regulations;

      * (iv) service requirements of the carriers;

      * (v) the cost of compliance in relation to the consumer benefits to be achieved from such compliance; and

      * (vi) the need to set the level of performance at a level designed to encourage carriers to offer service responsive to shipper needs.


  * (3) LIMITATIONS ON STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Secretary's authority to require reports from motor carriers providing transportation of household goods or to require such carriers to provide specified information to consumers concerning their past performance.


* (b) ESTIMATES.—

  * (1) REQUIRED TO BE IN WRITING.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, every motor carrier providing transportation of household goods described in section 13102(10)(A) as a household goods motor carrier and subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 shall conduct a physical survey of the household goods to be transported on behalf of a prospective individual shipper and shall provide the shipper with a written estimate of charges for the transportation and all related services.

    * (B) WAIVER.—A shipper may elect to waive a physical survey under this paragraph by written agreement signed by the shipper before the shipment is loaded. A copy of the waiver agreement must be retained as an addendum to the bill of lading and shall be subject to the same record inspection and preservation requirements of the Secretary as are applicable to bills of lading.

    * (C) ESTIMATE.—

      * (i) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding a waiver under subparagraph (B), a carrier's statement of charges for transportation must be submitted to the shipper in writing and must indicate whether it is binding or nonbinding. The written estimate shall be based on a physical survey of the household goods if the household goods are located within a 50-mile radius of the location of the carrier's household goods agent preparing the estimate.

      * (ii) BINDING.—A binding estimate under this paragraph must indicate that the carrier and shipper are bound by such charges. The carrier may impose a charge for providing a written binding estimate.

      * (iii) NONBINDING.—A nonbinding estimate under this paragraph must indicate that the actual charges will be based upon the actual weight of the individual shipper's shipment and the carrier's lawful tariff charges. The carrier may not impose a charge for providing a nonbinding estimate.


  * (2) OTHER INFORMATION.—At the time that a motor carrier provides the written estimate required by paragraph (1), the motor carrier shall provide the shipper a copy of the Department of Transportation publication FMCSA–ESA–03–005 (or its successor publication) entitled "Ready to Move?". Before the execution of a contract for service, the motor carrier shall provide the shipper copy of the Department of Transportation publication OCE 100, entitled "Your Rights and Responsibilities When You Move" required by section 375.213 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).

  * (3) APPLICABILITY OF ANTITRUST LAWS.—Any charge for an estimate of charges provided by a motor carrier to a shipper for transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).


* (c) FLEXIBILITY IN WEIGHING SHIPMENTS.—The Secretary shall issue regulations that provide motor carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 with the maximum possible flexibility in weighing shipments, consistent with assurance to the shipper of accurate weighing practices. The Secretary shall not prohibit such carriers from backweighing shipments or from basing their charges on the reweigh weights if the shipper observes both the tare and gross weighings (or, prior to such weighings, waives in writing the opportunity to observe such weighings) and such weighings are performed on the same scale.
