### SUBCHAPTER B—PROBATION

### §3561. Sentence of probation
* (a) IN GENERAL.—A defendant who has been found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to a term of probation unless—

  * (1) the offense is a Class A or Class B felony and the defendant is an individual;

  * (2) the offense is an offense for which probation has been expressly precluded; or

  * (3) the defendant is sentenced at the same time to a term of imprisonment for the same or a different offense that is not a petty offense.


* (b) DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS.—A defendant who has been convicted for the first time of a domestic violence crime shall be sentenced to a term of probation if not sentenced to a term of imprisonment. The term "domestic violence crime" means a crime of violence for which the defendant may be prosecuted in a court of the United States in which the victim or intended victim is the spouse, former spouse, intimate partner, former intimate partner, child, or former child of the defendant, or any other relative of the defendant.

* (c) AUTHORIZED TERMS.—The authorized terms of probation are—

  * (1) for a felony, not less than one nor more than five years;

  * (2) for a misdemeanor, not more than five years; and

  * (3) for an infraction, not more than one year.

### §3562. Imposition of a sentence of probation
* (a) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING A TERM OF PROBATION.—The court, in determining whether to impose a term of probation, and, if a term of probation is to be imposed, in determining the length of the term and the conditions of probation, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.

* (b) EFFECT OF FINALITY OF JUDGMENT.—Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence of probation can subsequently be—

  * (1) modified or revoked pursuant to the provisions of section 3564 or 3565;

  * (2) corrected pursuant to the provisions of rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3742; or

  * (3) appealed and modified, if outside the guideline range, pursuant to the provisions of section 3742;


* a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes.

### §3563. Conditions of probation
* (a) MANDATORY CONDITIONS.—The court shall provide, as an explicit condition of a sentence of probation—

  * (1) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction, that the defendant not commit another Federal, State, or local crime during the term of probation;

  * (2) for a felony, that the defendant also abide by at least one condition set forth in subsection (b)(2) or (b)(12), unless the court has imposed a fine under this chapter, or unless the court finds on the record that extraordinary circumstances exist that would make such a condition plainly unreasonable, in which event the court shall impose one or more of the other conditions set forth under subsection (b);

  * (3) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction, that the defendant not unlawfully possess a controlled substance;

  * (4) for a domestic violence crime as defined in section 3561(b) by a defendant convicted of such an offense for the first time that the defendant attend a public, private, or private nonprofit offender rehabilitation program that has been approved by the court, in consultation with a State Coalition Against Domestic Violence or other appropriate experts, if an approved program is readily available within a 50-mile radius of the legal residence of the defendant;

  * (5) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to one drug test within 15 days of release on probation and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court) for use of a controlled substance, but the condition stated in this paragraph may be ameliorated or suspended by the court for any individual defendant if the defendant's presentence report or other reliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of future substance abuse by the defendant;

  * (6) that the defendant—

    * (A) make restitution in accordance with sections 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, 3663A, and 3664; and

    * (B) pay the assessment imposed in accordance with section 3013;


  * (7) that the defendant will notify the court of any material change in the defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's ability to pay restitution, fines, or special assessments;

  * (8) for a person required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, that the person comply with the requirements of that Act; and

  * (9) that the defendant cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample from the defendant if the collection of such a sample is authorized pursuant to section 3 of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000.


* If the court has imposed and ordered execution of a fine and placed the defendant on probation, payment of the fine or adherence to the court-established installment schedule shall be a condition of the probation.

* (b) DISCRETIONARY CONDITIONS.—The court may provide, as further conditions of a sentence of probation, to the extent that such conditions are reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2) and to the extent that such conditions involve only such deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in section 3553(a)(2), that the defendant—

  * (1) support his dependents and meet other family responsibilities;

  * (21) be ordered deported by a United States district court, or United States magistrate judge, pursuant to a stipulation entered into by the defendant and the United States under section 238(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, except that, in the absence of a stipulation, the United States district court or a United States magistrate judge, may order deportation as a condition of probation, if, after notice and hearing pursuant to such section, the Attorney General demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the alien is deportable;

  * (22) satisfy such other conditions as the court may impose or;

  * (23) if required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, submit his person, and any property, house, residence, vehicle, papers, computer, other electronic communication or data storage devices or media, and effects to search at any time, with or without a warrant, by any law enforcement or probation officer with reasonable suspicion concerning a violation of a condition of probation or unlawful conduct by the person, and by any probation officer in the lawful discharge of the officer's supervision functions.


* (c) MODIFICATIONS OF CONDITIONS.—The court may modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of a sentence of probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the conditions of probation.

* (d) WRITTEN STATEMENT OF CONDITIONS.—The court shall direct that the probation officer provide the defendant with a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the sentence is subject, and that is sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant's conduct and for such supervision as is required.

* (e) RESULTS OF DRUG TESTING.—The results of a drug test administered in accordance with subsection (a)(5) shall be subject to confirmation only if the results are positive, the defendant is subject to possible imprisonment for such failure, and either the defendant denies the accuracy of such test or there is some other reason to question the results of the test. A defendant who tests positive may be detained pending verification of a positive drug test result. A drug test confirmation shall be a urine drug test confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques or such test as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services may determine to be of equivalent accuracy. The court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs, or an individual's current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission guidelines from the rule of section 3565(b), when considering any action against a defendant who fails a drug test administered in accordance with subsection (a)(5).

### §3564. Running of a term of probation
* (a) COMMENCEMENT.—A term of probation commences on the day that the sentence of probation is imposed, unless otherwise ordered by the court.

* (b) CONCURRENCE WITH OTHER SENTENCES.—Multiple terms of probation, whether imposed at the same time or at different times, run concurrently with each other. A term of probation runs concurrently with any Federal, State, or local term of probation, supervised release, or parole for another offense to which the defendant is subject or becomes subject during the term of probation. A term of probation does not run while the defendant is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than thirty consecutive days.

* (c) EARLY TERMINATION.—The court, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, may, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation, terminate a term of probation previously ordered and discharge the defendant at any time in the case of a misdemeanor or an infraction or at any time after the expiration of one year of probation in the case of a felony, if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant and the interest of justice.

* (d) EXTENSION.—The court may, after a hearing, extend a term of probation, if less than the maximum authorized term was previously imposed, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation, pursuant to the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the term of probation.

* (e) SUBJECT TO REVOCATION.—A sentence of probation remains conditional and subject to revocation until its expiration or termination.

### §3565. Revocation of probation
* (a) CONTINUATION OR REVOCATION.—If the defendant violates a condition of probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation, the court may, after a hearing pursuant to Rule 32.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable—

  * (1) continue him on probation, with or without extending the term or modifying or enlarging the conditions; or

  * (2) revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the defendant under subchapter A.


* (b) MANDATORY REVOCATION FOR POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE OR FIREARM OR REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH DRUG TESTING.—If the defendant—

  * (1) possesses a controlled substance in violation of the condition set forth in section 3563(a)(3);

  * (2) possesses a firearm, as such term is defined in section 921 of this title, in violation of Federal law, or otherwise violates a condition of probation prohibiting the defendant from possessing a firearm;

  * (3) refuses to comply with drug testing, thereby violating the condition imposed by section 3563(a)(4); or

  * (4) as a part of drug testing, tests positive for illegal controlled substances more than 3 times over the course of 1 year;


* the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the defendant under subchapter A to a sentence that includes a term of imprisonment.

* (c) DELAYED REVOCATION.—The power of the court to revoke a sentence of probation for violation of a condition of probation, and to impose another sentence, extends beyond the expiration of the term of probation for any period reasonably necessary for the adjudication of matters arising before its expiration if, prior to its expiration, a warrant or summons has been issued on the basis of an allegation of such a violation.

### §3566. Implementation of a sentence of probation
* The implementation of a sentence of probation is governed by the provisions of subchapter A of chapter 229.
