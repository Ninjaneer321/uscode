* (d) ALTERNATIVE FINE BASED ON GAIN OR LOSS.—If any person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss, unless imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.

* (e) SPECIAL RULE FOR LOWER FINE SPECIFIED IN SUBSTANTIVE PROVISION.—If a law setting forth an offense specifies no fine or a fine that is lower than the fine otherwise applicable under this section and such law, by specific reference, exempts the offense from the applicability of the fine otherwise applicable under this section, the defendant may not be fined more than the amount specified in the law setting forth the offense.

### §3572. Imposition of a sentence of fine and related matters
* (a) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.—In determining whether to impose a fine, and the amount, time for payment, and method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider, in addition to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)—

  * (1) the defendant's income, earning capacity, and financial resources;

  * (2) the burden that the fine will impose upon the defendant, any person who is financially dependent on the defendant, or any other person (including a government) that would be responsible for the welfare of any person financially dependent on the defendant, relative to the burden that alternative punishments would impose;

  * (3) any pecuniary loss inflicted upon others as a result of the offense;

  * (4) whether restitution is ordered or made and the amount of such restitution;

  * (5) the need to deprive the defendant of illegally obtained gains from the offense;

  * (6) the expected costs to the government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation component of the sentence;

  * (7) whether the defendant can pass on to consumers or other persons the expense of the fine; and

  * (8) if the defendant is an organization, the size of the organization and any measure taken by the organization to discipline any officer, director, employee, or agent of the organization responsible for the offense and to prevent a recurrence of such an offense.


* (b) FINE NOT TO IMPAIR ABILITY TO MAKE RESTITUTION.—If, as a result of a conviction, the defendant has the obligation to make restitution to a victim of the offense, other than the United States, the court shall impose a fine or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such fine or penalty will not impair the ability of the defendant to make restitution.

* (c) EFFECT OF FINALITY OF JUDGMENT.—Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to pay a fine can subsequently be—

  * (1) modified or remitted under section 3573;

  * (2) corrected under rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3742; or

  * (3) appealed and modified under section 3742;


* a judgment that includes such a sentence is a final judgment for all other purposes.

* (d) TIME, METHOD OF PAYMENT, AND RELATED ITEMS.—(1) A person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including restitution, shall make such payment immediately, unless, in the interest of justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or in installments. If the court provides for payment in installments, the installments shall be in equal monthly payments over the period provided by the court, unless the court establishes another schedule.

* (2) If the judgment, or, in the case of a restitution order, the order, permits other than immediate payment, the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the court, but shall be the shortest time in which full payment can reasonably be made.

* (3) A judgment for a fine which permits payments in installments shall include a requirement that the defendant will notify the court of any material change in the defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's ability to pay the fine. Upon receipt of such notice the court may, on its own motion or the motion of any party, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests of justice require.

* (e) ALTERNATIVE SENTENCE PRECLUDED.—At the time a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine, the court may not impose an alternative sentence to be carried out if the fine is not paid.

* (f) RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF MONETARY OBLIGATION RELATING TO ORGANIZATION.—If a sentence includes a fine, special assessment, restitution or other monetary obligation (including interest) with respect to an organization, each individual authorized to make disbursements for the organization has a duty to pay the obligation from assets of the organization. If such an obligation is imposed on a director, officer, shareholder, employee, or agent of an organization, payments may not be made, directly or indirectly, from assets of the organization, unless the court finds that such payment is expressly permissible under applicable State law.

* (g) SECURITY FOR STAYED FINE.—If a sentence imposing a fine is stayed, the court shall, absent exceptional circumstances (as determined by the court)—

  * (1) require the defendant to deposit, in the registry of the district court, any amount of the fine that is due;

  * (2) require the defendant to provide a bond or other security to ensure payment of the fine; or

  * (3) restrain the defendant from transferring or dissipating assets.


* (h) DELINQUENCY.—A fine or payment of restitution is delinquent if a payment is more than 30 days late.

* (i) DEFAULT.—A fine or payment of restitution is in default if a payment is delinquent for more than 90 days. Notwithstanding any installment schedule, when a fine or payment of restitution is in default, the entire amount of the fine or restitution is due within 30 days after notification of the default, subject to the provisions of section 3613A.

### §3573. Petition of the Government for modification or remission
* Upon petition of the Government showing that reasonable efforts to collect a fine or assessment are not likely to be effective, the court may, in the interest of justice—

  * (1) remit all or part of the unpaid portion of the fine or special assessment, including interest and penalties;

  * (2) defer payment of the fine or special assessment to a date certain or pursuant to an installment schedule; or

  * (3) extend a date certain or an installment schedule previously ordered.


* A petition under this subsection shall be filed in the court in which sentence was originally imposed, unless the court transfers jurisdiction to another court. This section shall apply to all fines and assessments irrespective of the date of imposition.

### §3574. Implementation of a sentence of fine
* The implementation of a sentence to pay a fine is governed by the provisions of subchapter B of chapter 229.
