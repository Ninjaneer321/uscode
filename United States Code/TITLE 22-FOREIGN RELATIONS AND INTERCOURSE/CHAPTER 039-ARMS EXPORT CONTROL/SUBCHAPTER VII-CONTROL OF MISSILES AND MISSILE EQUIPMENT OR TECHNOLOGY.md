### §2797. Licensing
#### (a) Establishment of list of controlled items
* The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other appropriate departments and agencies, shall establish and maintain, as part of the United States Munitions List, a list of all items on the MTCR Annex the export of which is not controlled under section 4605(l) of title 50.

#### (b) Referral of license applications
* (1) A determination of the Secretary of State to approve a license for the export of an item on the list established under subsection (a) may be made only after the license application is referred to the Secretary of Defense.

* (2) Within 10 days after a license is issued for the export of an item on the list established under subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall provide to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce the license application and accompanying documents issued to the applicant, to the extent that the relevant Secretary indicates the need to receive such application and documents.

#### (c) Information sharing
* The Secretary of State shall establish a procedure for sharing information with appropriate officials of the intelligence community, as determined by the Director of Central Intelligence, and with other appropriate Government agencies, that will ensure effective monitoring of transfers of MTCR equipment or technology and other missile technology.

#### (d) Exports to space launch vehicle programs
* Within 15 days after the issuance of a license (including any brokering license) for the export of items valued at less than $50,000,000 that are controlled under this chapter pursuant to United States obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime and are goods or services that are intended to support the design, utilization, development, or production of a space launch vehicle system listed in Category I of the MTCR Annex, the Secretary shall transmit to the Congress a report describing the licensed export and rationale for approving such export, including the consistency of such export with United States missile nonproliferation policy. The requirement contained in the preceding sentence shall not apply to licenses for exports to countries that were members of the MTCR as of April 17, 1987.

### §2797a. Denial of transfer of missile equipment or technology by United States persons
#### (a) Sanctions
* (1) If the President determines that a United States person knowingly—

  * (A) exports, transfers, or otherwise engages in the trade of any item on the MTCR Annex, in violation of the provisions of section 2778 of this title, section 4604 or 4605 of title 50 or any regulations or orders issued under any such provisions,

  * (B) conspires to or attempts to engage in such export, transfer, or trade, or

  * (C) facilitates such export, transfer, or trade by any other person,


* then the President shall impose the applicable sanctions described in paragraph (2).

* (2) The sanctions which apply to a United States person under paragraph (1) are the following:

  * (A) If the item on the MTCR Annex involved in the export, transfer, or trade is missile equipment or technology within category II of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny to such United States person for a period of 2 years—

    * (i) United States Government contracts relating to missile equipment or technology; and

  * (B) conspires to or attempts to engage in such export, transfer, or trade, or

  * (C) facilitates such export, transfer, or trade by any other person,


* or if the President has made a determination with respect to a foreign person under section 4612(b)(1) of title 50, then the President shall impose on that foreign person the applicable sanctions under paragraph (2).

    * (i) United States Government contracts relating to missile equipment or technology; and

    * (ii) licenses for the transfer to such foreign person of missile equipment or technology controlled under this chapter.


  * (B) If the item involved in the export, transfer, or trade is within category I of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny, for a period of not less than 2 years—

    * (i) all United States Government contracts with such foreign person; and

  * Notwithstanding paragraph (1), subsection (a) shall apply to an entity subordinate to a government that engages in exports or transfers described in section 2295a(b)(3)(A) of this title.

#### (c) Effect of enforcement actions by MTCR adherents
* Sanctions set forth in subsection (a) may not be imposed under this section on a person with respect to acts described in such subsection or, if such sanctions are in effect against a person on account of such acts, such sanctions shall be terminated, if an MTCR adherent is taking judicial or other enforcement action against that person with respect to such acts, or that person has been found by the government of an MTCR adherent to be innocent of wrongdoing with respect to such acts, and if the President certifies to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives that—

Any person who relies in good faith on such an advisory opinion which states that the proposed activity would not subject a person to such sanctions, and any person who thereafter engages in such activity, may not be made subject to such sanctions on account of such activity.

#### (e) Waiver and report to Congress

* (2) In the event that the President decides to apply the waiver described in paragraph (1), the President shall so notify the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives not less than 45 working days before issuing the waiver. Such notification shall include a report fully articulating the rationale and circumstances which led the President to apply the waiver.

#### (f) Presumption
