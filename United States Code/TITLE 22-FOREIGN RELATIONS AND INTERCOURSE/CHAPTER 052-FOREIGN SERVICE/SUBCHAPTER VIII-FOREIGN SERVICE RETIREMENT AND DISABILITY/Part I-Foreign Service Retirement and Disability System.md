#### (e) Payment period for child
* The annuity payable to a child under subsection (c) or (d) shall begin on the day after the participant dies, or if the child is not then qualified, on the first day of the month in which the child becomes eligible. The annuity of a child shall terminate on the last day of the month which precedes the month in which eligibility ceases.

#### (f) Unmarried participants
* At the time of retirement an unmarried participant who does not have a former spouse for whose benefit a reduction is made under subsection (b) may elect to receive a reduced annuity and to provide for an annuity equal to 55 percent of the reduced annuity payable after his or her death to a beneficiary whose name is designated in writing to the Secretary of State. The annuity payable to a participant making such election shall be reduced by 10 percent of an annuity computed under subsection (a) and by 5 percent of an annuity so computed for each full 5 years the designated beneficiary is younger than the retiring participant, but such total reduction shall not exceed 40 percent. No such election of a reduced annuity payable to a beneficiary shall be valid until the participant has satisfactorily passed a physical examination as prescribed by the Secretary of State. The annuity payable to a beneficiary under this subsection shall begin on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month preceding the death of the beneficiary. An annuity which is reduced under this subsection (or any similar prior provision of law) shall, effective the first day of the month following the death of the beneficiary named under this subsection, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced.

#### (g) Marriage after retirement
* A participant or former participant who was unmarried at retirement and who later marries may, within one year after such marriage, irrevocably elect in writing to receive a reduced annuity and to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse (if such spouse qualifies as a surviving spouse under section 4044(13) of this title). Receipt by the Secretary of State of notice of an election under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made under subsection (f). The reduction in annuity required by an election under this subsection shall be computed and the amount of the survivor annuity shall be determined in accordance with subsections (b)(2) and (3). The annuity reduction or recomputation shall be effective the first day of the month beginning one year after the date of marriage.

#### (h) Election of benefits
* A surviving spouse or surviving former spouse of any participant or former participant shall not become entitled to a survivor annuity or to the restoration of a survivor annuity payable from the Fund under this part unless the survivor elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which he or she may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than that participant.

#### (i) Reversion to retired status
* (1) Any married annuitant who reverts to retired status with entitlement to a supplemental annuity under section 4063 of this title shall, unless the annuitant and his or her spouse jointly elect in writing to the contrary at that time, have the supplemental annuity reduced by 10 percent to provide a supplemental survivor annuity for his or her spouse. Such supplemental survivor annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of the supplemental annuity of the annuitant and shall be payable to a surviving spouse to whom the annuitant was married at the time of reversion to retired status or whom the annuitant subsequently married.

* (2) The Secretary of State shall issue regulations to provide for the application of paragraph (1) of this subsection and of section 4063 of this title in any case in which an annuitant has a former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service and who qualifies for an annuity under this part.

#### (j) Recomputation upon dissolution of marriage; election after remarriage
* An annuity which is reduced under this section or any similar prior provision of law to provide a survivor benefit for a spouse shall, if the marriage of the participant to such spouse is dissolved, be recomputed and paid for each full month during which an annuitant is not married (or is remarried if there is no election in effect under the following sentence) as if the annuity had not been so reduced, subject to any reduction required to provide a survivor benefit under section 4054(b) or (c) of this title. Upon remarriage the retired participant may irrevocably elect, by means of a signed writing received by the Secretary within one year after such remarriage, to receive during such marriage a reduction in annuity for the purpose of allowing an annuity for the new spouse of the annuitant in the event such spouse survives the annuitant. Such reduction shall be equal to the reduction in effect immediately before the dissolution of the previous marriage (unless such reduction is adjusted under section 4054(b)(5) of this title), and shall be effective the first day of the first month beginning one year after the date of remarriage. A survivor annuity elected under this subsection shall be treated in all respects as a survivor annuity under subsection (b).

#### (k) Informing of rights by Secretary
* The Secretary of State shall, on an annual basis—

  * (1) inform each participant of his or her right of election under subsections (g) and (j); and

  * (2) to the maximum extent practicable, inform spouses or former spouses of participants or former participants of their rights under this section and section 4054 of this title.

#### (l) Repealed. Pub. L. 100–238, title II, §217(c)(1), Jan. 8, 1988, 101 Stat. 1775
#### (m) Offset of Social Security benefits
* The retirement, disability, or survivor annuity payable to any person based on the service of an individual subject to section 4045(h) of this title beginning with the first day of the month for which such person first becomes—

  * (1) eligible for an annuity under this part based on the service of such individual, and

  * (2) entitled, or would, upon proper application, be entitled to old age, disability, or survivor benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.], based on the service of such individual under this part,


* shall be computed as if section 8349 of title 5 were applicable.

#### (n) 18-month period to elect survivor annuity
* (1)(A) A participant—

  * (i) who, at the time of retirement, is married; and

  * (ii) who elects at such time (in accordance with subsection (b)) to waive a survivor annuity,


* may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such participant, elect to have a reduction under subsection (b) made in the annuity of the participant (or in such portion thereof as the participant may designate) in order to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse of such participant.

* (B) A participant—

  * (i) who, at the time of retirement, is married, and

  * (ii) who at such time designates (in accordance with subsection (b)) that a limited portion of the annuity of such participant is to be used as the base for a survivor annuity,


* may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such participant, elect to have a greater portion of the annuity of such participant so used.

* (2)(A) An election under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be considered effective unless the amount specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the applicable 18-month period under paragraph (1).

* (B) The amount to be deposited with respect to an election under this subsection is an amount equal to the sum of—

  * (i) the additional cost to the System which is associated with providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section and results from such election taking into account (I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such former participant under this part and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity, and (II) the costs associated with providing the later election; and

  * (ii) interest on the additional cost determined under clause (i)(I) of this subparagraph computed using the interest rate specified or determined under section 4045(d)(3) of this title for the calendar year in which the amount to be deposited is determined.


* (3) An election by a participant under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in the case of such participant under subsection (b).

* (4) An annuity which is reduced in connection with an election under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the participant whose annuity is so reduced.

* (5) Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the participant involved elected such annuity at the time of retiring.

### §4047. Payment of annuity
#### (a) Commencement of annuity
* (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2), the annuity of a participant who has met the eligibility requirements for an annuity shall commence on the first day of the month after—

  * (A) separation from the Service occurs; or

  * (B) pay ceases and the service and age requirements for entitlement to annuity are met.


* (2) The annuity of—

  * (A) a participant who is retired and is eligible for benefits under section 4009(a) of this title or a participant who is retired under section 4053 of this title or is otherwise involuntarily separated from the Service, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency,

  * (B) a participant retiring under section 4048 of this title due to a disability, and

  * (C) a participant who serves 3 days or less in the month of retirement—


* shall commence on the day after separation from the Service or the day after pay ceases and the requirements for entitlement to annuity are met.

#### (b) Survivor's annuity; application; proof of eligibility; payment to estate
* The annuity to a survivor shall become effective as otherwise specified but shall not be paid until the survivor submits an application for such annuity, supported by such proof of eligibility as the Secretary of State may require. If such application or proof of eligibility is not submitted during the lifetime of an otherwise eligible individual, no annuity shall be due or payable to his or her estate.

#### (c) Waiver
* An individual entitled to annuity from the Fund may decline to accept all or any part of the annuity by submitting a signed waiver to the Secretary of State. The waiver may be revoked in writing at any time. Payment of the annuity waived may not be made for the period during which the waiver was in effect.

#### (d) Recovery of overpayment
* Recovery of overpayments under this part may not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of the Secretary of State, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience or administratively infeasible.

#### (e) Alternate forms of annuities
* (1) The Secretary of State shall prescribe regulations under which any participant who has a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition may, at the time of retiring under this part (other than under section 4048 of this title), elect annuity benefits under this section instead of any other benefits under this part (including survivor benefits) based on the service of the participant.

* (2) Subject to paragraph (3), the Secretary of State shall by regulation provide for such alternative forms of annuities as the Secretary considers appropriate, except that among the alternatives offered shall be—

  * (A) an alternative which provides for—

    * (i) payment of the lump-sum credit (excluding interest) to the participant; and

    * (ii) payment of an annuity to the participant for life; and


  * (B) in the case of a participant who is married at the time of retirement, an alternative which provides for—

    * (i) payment of the lump-sum credit (excluding interest) to the participant; and

    * (ii) payment of an annuity to the participant for life, with a survivor annuity payable for the life of a surviving spouse.


* (3) Each alternative provided for under paragraph (2) shall, to the extent practicable, be designed such that the total value of the benefits provided under such alternative (including any lump-sum credit) is actuarially equivalent to the value of the annuity which would otherwise be provided the participant under this part, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title.

* (4) A participant who, at the time of retiring under this part—

  * (A) is married, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section unless a waiver is made under section 4046(b)(1)(B) of this title; or

  * (B) has a former spouse, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section if the former spouse is entitled to benefits under this part (based on the service of the participant) unless a waiver has been made under section 4046(b)(1)(C) of this title.


* (5) A participant who is married at the time of retiring under this part and who makes an election under this section may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of retirement, make the election provided for under section 4046(n) of this title, subject to the deposit requirement thereunder.

* (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any lump-sum credit provided pursuant to an election under this subsection shall not preclude an individual from receiving any other benefits under this subsection.

### §4048. Retirement for disability or incapacity
#### (a) Causes; service credit
* Any participant who has at least 5 years of service credit toward retirement under the System (excluding military and naval service) and who becomes totally disabled or incapacitated for useful and efficient service by reason of disease, illness, or injury (not due to vicious habits, intemperance, or willful conduct of the participant) shall, upon his or her own application or upon order of the Secretary, be retired on an annuity computed as prescribed in section 4046 of this title. If the disabled or incapacitated participant has less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the System at the time of retirement, his or her annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, except that the additional service credit that may accrue to a participant under this sentence shall in no case exceed the difference between his or her age at the time of retirement and age 60.

* However, if a participant retiring under this section is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 8332(c)(1) or (2) of title 5) or Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be computed under this part excluding extra credit authorized by this subsection and excluding credit for military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the application of the limitation in section 5532 of title 5 or the Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation in lieu of such retired pay or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would be payable under this part in the absence of the previous sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity computed under this part.

#### (b) Physical examination; reinstatement or reappointment upon recovery; fees and expenses; duration and suspension of annuity
* Before being retired under this section, the participant shall be given a physical examination by one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons designated by the Secretary of State to conduct examinations. Disability or incapacity shall be determined by the Secretary of State on the basis of the advice of such physicians or surgeons. Unless the disability or incapacity is permanent, like examinations shall be made annually until the annuitant has attained age 60. If the Secretary of State determines on the basis of the advice of one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons conducting such examinations that an annuitant has recovered to the extent that he or she can return to duty, the annuitant may apply for reinstatement or reappointment in the Service within 1 year from the date recovery is determined. Upon application, the Secretary shall reinstate such recovered annuitant in the class in which the annuitant was serving at time of retirement, or the Secretary may, taking into consideration the age, qualifications, and experience of such annuitant, and the present class of his or her contemporaries in the Service, appoint or recommend that the President appoint the annuitant to a higher class. Payment of the annuity shall continue until a date 6 months after the date of the examination showing recovery or until the date of reinstatement or reappointment in the Service, whichever is earlier. Fees for examinations under this section, together with reasonable traveling and other expenses incurred in order to submit to examination, shall be paid out of the Fund. If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required under this subsection, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability or incapacity is satisfactorily established.

#### (c) Benefits upon discontinuance of annuity
* If a recovered annuitant whose annuity is discontinued is for any reason not reinstated or reappointed in the Service, he or she shall be considered to have been separated within the meaning of section 4050 of this title as of the date of retirement for disability or incapacity and shall, after the discontinuance of the annuity, be entitled to the benefits of that section or of section 4055 of this title, except that he or she may elect voluntary retirement if eligible under section 4051 of this title.

#### (d) Election of benefits; concurrent benefits allowed
* No participant shall be entitled to receive an annuity under this part and compensation for injury or disability to himself or herself under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, covering the same period of time, except that a participant may simultaneously receive both an annuity under this section and scheduled disability payments under section 8107 of title 5. This subsection shall not bar the right of any claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this part or subchapter I of such chapter 8 for any part of the same period of time. Neither this subsection nor any provision of subchapter I of such chapter 8 shall be construed to deny the right of any participant to receive an annuity under this part and to receive concurrently any payment under subchapter I of such chapter 8 by reason of the death of any other individual.

#### (e) Lump sum disability payments
* Notwithstanding any other law, the right of any individual entitled to an annuity under this part shall not be affected because such person has received an award of compensation in a lump sum under section 8135 of title 5, except that where such annuity is payable on account of the same disability for which compensation under such section has been paid, so much of such compensation as has been paid for any period extended beyond the date such annuity becomes effective, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall be refunded to the Department of Labor, to be paid into the Federal Employees' Compensation Fund. Before such individual receives such annuity, he or she shall—

  * (1) refund to the Department of Labor the amount representing such commuted payments for such extended period, or

  * (2) authorize the deduction of such amount from the annuity payable under this part, which amount shall be transmitted to the Department of Labor for reimbursement to such Fund.


* Deductions from such annuity may be made from accrued and accruing payments, or may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Secretary of Labor shall determine, whenever the Secretary of Labor finds that the financial circumstances of the annuitant warrant deferred refunding.

#### (f) Time of filing application; waiver
* A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Secretary of State before the participant is separated from the Service or within one year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Secretary of State for a participant who at the date of separation from the Service or within one year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Secretary of State within one year from the date of restoration of the participant to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.

### §4049. Death in service
#### (a) Lump-sum credit
* If a participant dies and no claim for annuity is payable under this part, the lump-sum credit shall be paid in accordance with section 4055 of this title.

#### (b) Surviving spouse
* If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is survived by a spouse or former spouse qualifying for an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title, such surviving spouse shall be entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the annuity computed in accordance with subsections (e) and (g) of this section and section 4046(a) of this title and any surviving former spouse shall be entitled to an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title as if the participant died after being entitled to an annuity under this part. If the participant had less than 3 years creditable civilian service at the time of death, the survivor annuity shall be computed on the basis of the average salary for the entire period of such service.

#### (c) Surviving spouse or former spouse, and children
* If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, and a child or children, each surviving child shall be entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with subsections (c)(1) and (d) of section 4046 of this title.

#### (d) Surviving children
* If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is not survived by a spouse, or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with subsections (c)(2) and (d) of section 4046 of this title.

#### (e) Service credit; presumption of qualification
* If, at the time of his or her death, the participant had less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the System, the annuity payable in accordance with subsection (b) shall be computed in accordance with section 4046 of this title on the assumption he or she has had 20 years of service, except that the additional service credit that may accrue to a deceased participant under this subsection shall in no case exceed the difference between his or her age on the date of death and age 60. In all cases arising under this subsection or subsection (b), (c), (d), or (g), it shall be assumed that the deceased participant was qualified for retirement on the date of death.

#### (f) Recall service
* If an annuitant entitled to a reduced annuity dies in service after being recalled under section 3948 of this title and is survived by a spouse or former spouse entitled to a survivor annuity based on the service of such annuitant, such survivor annuity shall be computed as if the recall service had otherwise terminated on the day of death and the annuity of the deceased had been resumed in accordance with section 4063 of this title. If such death occurs after the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility for a supplemental annuity, a surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service shall be entitled to elect, in addition to any other benefits and in lieu of a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall service, a supplemental survivor annuity computed and paid under section 4046(i) of this title as if the recall service had otherwise terminated. If the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility to have his or her annuity determined anew, a surviving spouse or such a surviving former spouse may elect, in lieu of any other survivor benefit under this subchapter, to have the rights of the annuitant redetermined and to receive a survivor annuity computed under subsection (b) on the basis of the total service of the annuitant.

#### (g) Limitation on surviving spouse's annuity
* Notwithstanding subsection (b), if the participant or former participant had a former spouse qualifying for an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title, the annuity of the spouse under this section shall be subject to the limitation of section 4046(b)(3)(B) of this title.

#### (h) Commencement, termination, and resumption of annuities
* Annuities that become payable under this section shall commence, terminate, and be resumed in accordance with subsection (b)(4), (e), or (h) of section 4046 of this title, as appropriate.

### §4050. Discontinued service retirement
* Any participant who voluntarily separates from the Service after obtaining at least 5 years of service credit toward retirement under the System (excluding military and naval service) may upon separation from the Service or at any time prior to becoming eligible for an annuity elect to have his or her contributions to the Fund returned in accordance with section 4055 of this title, or to leave his or her contributions in the Fund and receive an annuity, computed under section 4046 of this title, commencing at age 60.

### §4051. Voluntary retirement
* Any participant who is at least 50 years of age and has 20 years of creditable service, including at least 5 years of service credit toward retirement under the System (excluding military and naval service), may on his or her own application and with the consent of the Secretary be retired from the Service and receive retirement benefits in accordance with section 4046 of this title. The Secretary shall withhold consent for retirement under this section by any participant who has not been a member of the Service for 5 years. Any participant who voluntarily separates from the Service before completing 5 years in the System and who, on the date of separation, would be eligible for an annuity, based on a voluntary separation, under section 8336 or 8338 of title 5, if the participant had been covered under the Civil Service Retirement System rather than subject to this subchapter while a member of the Service, may receive an annuity under section 8336 or 8338, notwithstanding section 8333(b) of title 5, if all contributions transferred to the Fund under section 4045(c)(1) of this title, as well as all contributions withheld from the participant's pay or contributed by the employer, and deposited into the Fund during the period he or she was subject to this subchapter, including interest on these amounts, are transferred to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund effective on the date the participant separates from the Service.

### §4052. Mandatory retirement
* (a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (b), any participant shall be retired from the Service at the end of the month in which the participant has reached age 65 and has at least 5 years of service credit toward retirement under the System (excluding military and naval service), and shall receive retirement benefits in accordance with section 4046 of this title.

* (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)—

  * (A) an individual described in section 4(a)(2) of the Department of State Special Agents Retirement Act of 1998 who is otherwise eligible for immediate retirement under this subchapter; or

  * (B) a Foreign Service criminal investigator/inspector of the Office of Inspector General of the Agency for International Development who would have been eligible for retirement pursuant to either section 8336(c) or 8412(d) of title 5, as applicable, had the employee remained in civil service,


* shall be separated from the Service on the last day of the month in which such individual under subparagraph (A) or such Foreign Service criminal investigator/inspector under subparagraph (B) attains 57 years of age or completes 20 years of service if then over that age. If the head of the agency judges that the public interest so requires, that agency head may exempt such an employee from automatic separation under this subsection until that employee attains 60 years of age. The employing office shall notify the employee in writing of the date of separation at least 60 days before that date. Action to separate the employee is not effective without the consent of the employee, until the last day of the month in which the 60-day notice expires.

* (b)(1) Any participant who is otherwise required to retire under subsection (a) while occupying a position to which he or she was appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, may continue to serve until that appointment is terminated.

* (2) Whenever the Secretary determines it to be in the public interest, any participant who is otherwise required to retire under subsection (a) may be retained on active service for a period not to exceed 5 years.

* (3) Any participant who completes a period of service authorized by this subsection shall be retired at the end of the month in which such authorized service is completed.

### §4053. Reassignment and retirement of former Presidential appointees
#### (a) Reassignment or retirement of participants not eligible for retirement
* A participant, who completes an assignment under section 3942(b) of this title in a position to which the participant was appointed by the President, and is not otherwise eligible for retirement—

  * (1) shall be reassigned within 90 days after the termination of such assignment and any period of authorized leave, or

  * (2) if the Secretary of State determines that reassignment is not in the interest of the Foreign Service, shall be retired from the Service and receive retirement benefits in accordance with section 4046 or 4071d of this title, as appropriate.

#### (b) Retirement of participants eligible for retirement
* A participant who completes an assignment under section 3942(b) of this title in a position to which the participant was appointed by the President and is eligible for retirement and is not reassigned within 90 days after the termination of such assignment and any period of authorized leave, shall be retired from the Service and receive retirement benefits in accordance with section 4046 of this title or section 4071d of this title, as appropriate.

#### (c) Retirement of reemployed participants
* A participant who is retired under subsection (a)(2) and is subsequently employed by the United States Government, thereafter, shall be eligible to retire only under the terms of the applicable retirement system.

### §4054. Former spouses
#### (a) Living Service members
* (1) Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title, a former spouse of a participant or former participant is entitled to an annuity if such former spouse was married to the participant for at least 10 years during service of the participant which is creditable under this subchapter with at least 5 of such years occurring while the participant was a member of the Foreign Service and—

  * (A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of the annuity of the participant; or

  * (B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that former spouse's pro rata share of 50 percent of such annuity.


* For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "creditable service" means service which is creditable under part I or II.

* (2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.

* (3) The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the later of the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this part or the first day of the month in which the divorce or annulment involved becomes final. The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto terminate on—

  * (A) the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 60 years of age; or

  * (B) the date the annuity of the participant terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to paragraph (5)(B)).


* (4) No spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title involving any participant may provide for an annuity or any combination of annuities under this subsection which exceeds the annuity of the participant, nor may any such court order relating to an annuity under this subsection be given effect if it is issued more than 24 months after the date the divorce or annulment involved becomes final.

* (5)(A) The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such reduction shall be disregarded in calculating the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this part, and in calculating any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) or section 4046(b)(3) of this title.

* (B) If any annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph (A) is recalled to service under section 3948 of this title, or reinstated or reappointed in the Service in the case of a recovered disability annuitant or if any annuitant is reemployed as provided for under section 4064 of this title, the salary of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund.

* (6) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of any former spouse of a disability annuitant—

  * (A) the annuity of that former spouse shall commence on the date the participant would qualify on the basis of his or her creditable service for an annuity under this part (other than a disability annuity) or the date the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and

  * (B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.


* (7) An annuity under this subsection shall be treated the same as a survivor annuity under subsection (b) for purposes of section 4046(h) of this title or any comparable provision of law.

#### (b) Deceased Service members
* (1) Subject to any election under section 4046(b)(1)(C) of this title and unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title, if a former participant who is entitled to receive an annuity is survived by a former spouse, the former spouse shall be entitled to a survivor annuity—

  * (A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title; or

* (B) Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section 4046(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.

  * (ii) any amount accruing to the Fund under subparagraph (A) shall be refunded, but only to the extent that such amount may have exceeded the actuarial cost of providing benefits under this subsection for the period such benefits were provided, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State.


* (D) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State, an annuity shall be recomputed (or salary allotment terminated or adjusted), and a refund provided (if appropriate), in a manner comparable to that provided under subparagraph (C), in order to reflect a termination or reduction of future benefits under this subsection for a spouse in the event a former spouse of the participant dies or remarries before attaining age 60 and an increased annuity is provided for that spouse in accordance with this part.

No such extra credit for service at such unhealthful posts shall be credited to any participant who is paid a differential under section 5925 or 5928 of title 5 for such service. Such extra credit may not be used to determine the eligibility of a person to qualify as a former spouse under this part, or to compute the pro rata share under section 4044(10) of this title.
