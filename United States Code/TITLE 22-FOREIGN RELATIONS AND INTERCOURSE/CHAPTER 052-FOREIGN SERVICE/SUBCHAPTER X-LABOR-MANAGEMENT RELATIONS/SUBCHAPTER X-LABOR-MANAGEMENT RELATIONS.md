  * (2) that a hearing will be held before the Board (or any member thereof or before an individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose); and

  * (3) of the time and place fixed for the hearing.

#### (c) Answer; personal appearance
* The labor organization or Department involved shall have the right to file an answer to the original and any amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint for the hearing.

#### (d) Time of filing of charges
* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no complaint shall be issued based on any alleged unfair labor practice which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge with the Board.

* (2) If the General Counsel determines that the person filing any charge was prevented from filing the charge during the 6-month period referred to in paragraph (1) by reason of—

  * (A) any failure of the Department or labor organization against which the charge is made to perform a duty owed to the person, or

  * (B) any concealment which prevented discovery of the alleged unfair labor practice during the 6-month period,


* the General Counsel may issue a complaint based on the charge if the charge was filed during the 6-month period beginning on the day of the discovery by the person of the alleged unfair labor practice.

#### (e) Regulations providing for resolution through informal methods
* The General Counsel may prescribe regulations providing for informal methods by which the alleged unfair labor practice may be resolved prior to the issuance of a complaint.

#### (f) Hearing
* The Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) shall conduct a hearing on the complaint not earlier than 5 days after the date on which the complaint is served. In the discretion of the individual or individuals conducting the hearing, any person involved may be allowed to intervene in the hearing and to present testimony. Any such hearing shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, except that the parties shall not be bound by rules of evidence, whether statutory, common law, or adopted by a court. A transcript shall be kept of the hearing. After such a hearing the Board, in its discretion, may upon notice receive further evidence or hear argument.

#### (g) Findings of fact relative to issuance of orders; backpay
* If the Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) determines after any hearing on a complaint under subsection (f) that the preponderance of the evidence received demonstrates that the Department or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, then the individual or individuals conducting the hearing shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the Department or labor organization an order—

  * (1) to cease and desist from any such unfair labor practice in which the Department or labor organization is engaged;

  * (2) requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the order of the Board and requiring that the agreement, as amended, be given retroactive effect;

  * (3) requiring reinstatement of an employee with backpay in accordance with section 5596 of title 5; or

  * (4) including any combination of the actions described in paragraphs (1) through (3) or such other action as will carry out the purpose of this subchapter.


* If any such order requires reinstatement of an employee with backpay, backpay may be required of the Department (as provided in section 5596 of title 5) or of the labor organization, as the case may be, which is found to have engaged in the unfair labor practice involved.

#### (h) Findings of fact requiring dismissal of complaint
* If the individual or individuals conducting the hearing determine that the preponderance of the evidence received fails to demonstrate that the Department or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, the individual or individuals shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint.

### §4117. Standards of conduct for labor organizations
#### (a) Freedom from corrupt influences and influences opposed to basic democratic principles
* The Department shall accord recognition only to a labor organization that is free from corrupt influences and influences opposed to basic democratic principles. Except as provided in subsection (b), an organization is not required to prove that it is free from such influences if it is subject to a governing requirement adopted by the organization or by a national or international labor organization or federation of labor organizations with which it is affiliated, or in which it participates, containing explicit and detailed provisions to which it subscribes calling for—

  * (1) the maintenance of democratic procedures and practices, including—

    * (A) provisions for periodic elections to be conducted subject to recognized safeguards, and

    * (B) provisions defining and securing the right of individual members to participate in the affairs of the organization, to receive fair and equal treatment under the governing rules of the organization, and to receive fair process in disciplinary proceedings;

#### (b) Furnishing of information
* A labor organization may be required to furnish evidence of its freedom from corrupt influences opposed to basic democratic principles if there is reasonable cause to believe that—

  * (1) the organization has been suspended or expelled from, or is subject to other sanction by, a parent labor organization, or federation of organizations with which it has been affiliated, because it has demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to comply with governing requirements comparable in purpose to those required by subsection (a); or

  * (2) the organization is in fact subject to influences that would preclude recognition under this subchapter.

#### (c) Reports; bonding of officials and other employees; compliance with trusteeship and election standards

#### (e) Participation in labor organizations restricted
* (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter—

  * (D) any individual described in section 4102(12)(B), (C), or (D) of this title who is not involved in the administration of this subchapter or in the formulation of the personnel policies and programs of the Department.

#### (f) Willful and intentional violations
* If the Board finds that any labor organization has willfully and intentionally violated section 4115(b)(7) of this title by omission or commission with regard to any strike, work stoppage, slowdown, the Board shall—

Any such assignment shall be made at no cost to the exclusive representative or the individual. Except as provided in subsection (b), any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of one year from its execution.

  * (3) the individual is suspended or expelled from membership in the exclusive representative.

#### (c) Negotiations with uncertified labor organizations

Negotiations under this subsection shall be concerned solely with the deduction of dues of the labor organization from the salary of the individuals who are members of the labor organization and who make a voluntary allotment for that purpose. Any agreement between the Department and a labor organization under this subsection shall terminate upon the certification of an exclusive representative of any employees to whom the agreement applies.

#### (d) Official time usage
* The following provisions shall apply to the use of official time:

  * (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), any employee representing an exclusive representative, or engaged in any other matter covered by this subchapter, shall be granted official time in any amount the Department and the exclusive representative agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.
