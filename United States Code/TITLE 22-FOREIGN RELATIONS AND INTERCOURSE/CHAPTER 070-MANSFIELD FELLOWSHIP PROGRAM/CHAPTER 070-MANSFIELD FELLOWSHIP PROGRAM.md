### §6101. Establishment of Fellowship Program
#### (a) Establishment
* (1) There is hereby established the "Mike Mansfield Fellowship Program" pursuant to which the Director of the United States Information Agency will make grants, subject to the availability of appropriations, to the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs to award fellowships to eligible United States citizens for periods of 2 years each (or, pursuant to section 6102(5)(C) of this title, for such shorter period of time as the Center may determine based on a Fellow's level of proficiency in the Japanese language or knowledge of the political economy of Japan) as follows:

  * (A) During the first year each fellowship recipient will study the Japanese language as well as Japan's political economy.

  * (B) During the second year each fellowship recipient will serve as a fellow in a parliamentary office, ministry, or other agency of the Government of Japan or, subject to the approval of the Center, a nongovernmental Japanese institution associated with the interests of the fellowship recipient, and the agency of the United States Government from which the fellow originated, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.


* (2) Fellowships under this chapter may be known as "Mansfield Fellowships", and individuals awarded such fellowships may be known as "Mansfield Fellows".

#### (e) Use of Federal facilities
* The George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center is authorized and encouraged to assist, on a reimbursable basis, in carrying out Japanese language training by the Center through the provision of teachers, classroom space, teaching materials, and facilities, to the extent that such provision is not detrimental to the Institute's carrying out its other responsibilities under law.

  * (4) During the period of the fellowship, the Center shall provide—

    * (A) to each fellow who is not a detailee a stipend at a rate of pay equal to the rate of pay that individual was receiving when he or she entered the program, plus a cost-of-living adjustment calculated at the same rate of pay, and for the same period of time, for which such adjustments were made to the salaries of individuals occupying competitive positions in the civil service during the same period as the fellowship; and

    * (B) to each fellow (including detailees) certain allowances and benefits as that individual would have been entitled to, but for his or her separation from Government service, as a United States Government civilian employee overseas under the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) of the Department of State, as follows: a living quarters allowance to cover the higher cost of housing in Japan, a post allowance to cover the significantly higher costs of living in Japan, an education allowance to assist parents in providing their children with educational services ordinarily provided without charge by United States public schools, moving expenses of up to $1,000 for personal belongings of fellows and their families in their move to Japan and one-round-trip economy-class airline ticket to Japan for each fellow and the fellow's immediate family.
