### §1456. Utilization of facilities and personnel of other Government agencies; reimbursement to agencies; report to Congress
* The Secretary is authorized, in carrying on any activity under the authority of this chapter, to utilize, with the approval of the President, the services, facilities, and personnel of the other Government agencies. Whenever the Secretary shall use the services, facilities, or personnel of any Government agency for activities under authority of this chapter, the Secretary shall pay for such performance out of funds available to the Secretary under this chapter, either in advance, by reimbursement, or direct transfer. The Secretary shall include in each report submitted to the Congress under section 1439 of this title a statement of the services, facilities, and personnel of other Government agencies utilized in carrying on activities under the authority of this chapter, showing the names and salaries of the personnel utilized, or performing services utilized, during the period covered by such report, and the amounts paid to such other agencies under this section as payment for such performance.

### §1457. Rendition of technical and other services to foreign governments; limitations
* A Government agency, at the request of the Secretary, may perform such technical or other services as such agency may be competent to render for the government of another country desirous of obtaining such services, upon terms and conditions which are satisfactory to the Secretary and to the head of the Government agency, when it is determined by the Secretary that such services will contribute to the purposes of this chapter. However, nothing in this chapter shall authorize the performance of services relating to the organization, training, operation, development, or combat equipment of the armed forces of a foreign government.

### §1458. Policy governing rendition of services
* In authorizing the performance of technical and other services under this subchapter, it is the sense of the Congress (1) that the Secretary shall encourage through any appropriate Government agency the performance of such services to foreign governments by qualified private American individuals and agencies, and shall not enter into the performance of such services to any foreign government where such services may be performed adequately by qualified private American individuals and agencies and such qualified individuals and agencies are available for the performance of such services; (2) that if such services are rendered by a Government agency, they shall demonstrate the technical accomplishments of the United States, such services being of an advisory, investigative, or instructional nature, or a demonstration of a technical process; (3) that such services shall not include the construction of public works or the supervision of the construction of public works, and that, under authority of this chapter, a Government agency shall render engineering services related to public works only when the Secretary shall determine that the national interest demands the rendering of such services by a Government agency, but this policy shall not be interpreted to preclude the assignment of individual specialists as advisers to other governments as provided under subchapter III of this chapter, together with such incidental assistance as may be necessary for the accomplishment of their individual assignments.
