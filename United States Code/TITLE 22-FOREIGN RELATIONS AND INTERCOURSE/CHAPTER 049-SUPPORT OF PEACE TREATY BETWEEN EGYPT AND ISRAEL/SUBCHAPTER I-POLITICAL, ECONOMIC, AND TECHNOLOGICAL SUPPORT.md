### SUBCHAPTER I—POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT

### §3401. Congressional findings and declaration of policy
#### (a) Policy of support for peace treaty
* It is the policy of the United States to support the peace treaty concluded between the Government of Egypt and the Government of Israel on March 26, 1979. This treaty is a significant step toward a full and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The Congress urges the President to continue to exert every effort to bring about a comprehensive peace and to seek an end by all parties to the violence which could jeopardize this peace.

#### (b) Findings
* The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel having been ratified, the Congress finds that the national interests of the United States are served—

  * (1) by authorizing the President to construct air bases in Israel to replace the Israeli air bases on the Sinai peninsula that are to be evacuated;

  * (2) by authorizing additional funds to finance procurements by Egypt and Israel through the fiscal year 1982 of defense articles and defense services for their respective security requirements; and

  * (3) by authorizing additional funds for economic assistance for Egypt in order to promote the economic stability and development of that country and to support the peace process in the Middle East.

#### (c) Other agreements, understandings, or commitments
* The authorities contained in this subchapter to implement certain arrangements in support of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel do not signify approval by the Congress of any other agreement, understanding, or commitment made by the executive branch.

### §3402. Supplemental authorization of foreign military sales loan guaranties for Egypt and Israel
#### (a) Congressional findings; use of Arms Export Control Act procedures
* The Congress finds that the legitimate defense interests of Israel and Egypt require a one time extraordinary assistance package due to Israel's phased withdrawal from the Sinai and Egypt's shift from reliance on Soviet weaponry. The authorizations contained in this section do not, however, constitute Congressional approval of the sale of any particular weapons system to either country. These sales will be reviewed under the normal procedures set forth in section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2776(b)].

#### (b) Authorization of appropriation
* In addition to amounts authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year 1979 by section 31(a) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2771(a)], there is authorized to be appropriated to the President to carry out that Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] $370,000,000 for the fiscal year 1979.

#### (c) Principal amounts of guaranteed loans
* Funds made available pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may be used only for guaranties for Egypt and Israel pursuant to section 24(a) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2764(a)]. The principal amount of loans guaranteed with such funds may not exceed $3,700,000,000 of which $2,200,000,000 shall be available only for Israel and $1,500,000,000 shall be available only for Egypt. The principal amount of such guaranteed loans shall be in addition to the aggregate ceiling authorized for the fiscal year 1979 by section 31(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2771(b)].

#### (d) Repayment schedule
* Loans guaranteed with funds made available pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be on terms calling for repayment within a period of not less than thirty years, including an initial grace period of ten years on repayment of principal.

#### (e) Modification of terms of guaranteed loans
* (1) The Congress finds that the Governments of Israel and Egypt each have an enormous external debt burden which may be made more difficult by virtue of the financing authorized by this section. The Congress further finds that, as a consequence of the impact of the debt burdens incurred by Israel and Egypt under such financing, it may become necessary in future years to modify the terms of the loans guaranteed with funds made available pursuant to this section.

* (2) Repealed. Pub. L. 97–113, title VII, §734(a)(4), Dec. 29, 1981, 95 Stat. 1560.

### §3403. Supplemental authorization of economic support for Egypt
* There is authorized to be appropriated to the President to carry out chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.], $300,000,000 for the fiscal year 1979 for Egypt, in addition to amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated for such chapter for the fiscal year 1979. The amounts appropriated pursuant to this section may be made available until expended.

### §3404. Transfer of facilities of United States Sinai Field Mission to Egypt
* The President is authorized to transfer to Egypt, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, such of the facilities and related property of the United States Sinai Field Mission as he may determine, upon the termination of the activities of the Sinai Field Mission in accordance with the terms of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.

### §3405. Contributions by other countries to support peace in the Middle East
#### (a) Presidential consultations with other countries
* It is the sense of the Congress that other countries should give favorable consideration to providing support for the implementation of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Therefore, the Congress requests that the President consult with other countries in order to (1) promote and develop an agreement for the establishment of a peace development fund whose purpose would be to underwrite the costs of implementing a Middle East peace, and (2) encourage investments in Israel and Egypt and other countries in the region should they join in Middle East peace agreements.

#### (b) Repealed. Pub. L. 97–113, title VII, §734(a)(4), Dec. 29, 1981, 95 Stat. 1560

### §3406. Trilateral scientific and technological cooperation by Egypt, Israel, and United States
#### (a) Preparation for United States participation
* It is the sense of the Congress that, in order to continue to build the structure of peace in the Middle East, the United States should be prepared to participate, at an appropriate time, in trilateral cooperative projects of a scientific and technological nature involving Egypt, Israel, and the United States.

#### (b) Plan development
* Therefore, the President shall develop a plan to guide the participation of both United States Government agencies and private institutions in such projects. This plan shall identify—

  * (1) potential projects in a variety of areas appropriate for scientific and technological cooperation by the three countries, including agriculture, health, energy, the environment, education, and water resources;

  * (2) the resources which are available or which would be needed to implement such projects; and

  * (3) the means by which such projects would be implemented.

### §3408. Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons
* In accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 [22 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.], the Congress strongly encourages all countries in the Middle East which are not parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to become parties to that Treaty.
