    * (A) in 2006—

      * (i) stated, "Given [North Korea's] counterfeiting of U.S. currency, narcotics trafficking and use of accounts world-wide to conduct proliferation-related transactions, the line between illicit and licit North Korean money is nearly invisible."; and

      * (ii) urged financial institutions worldwide to "think carefully about the risks of doing any North Korea-related business";

      * (i) "remains intent on engaging in proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing in material"; and

      * (ii) was "aggressively pursuing the effort to establish front companies."; and


    * (C) in 2013, stated—

      * (i) in reference to North Korea's distribution of high-quality counterfeit United States currency, that "North Korea is continuing to try to pass a supernote into the international financial system"; and

      * (ii) the Department of the Treasury would soon introduce new currency with improved security features to protect against counterfeiting by the Government of North Korea.


  * (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, has repeatedly—

    * (A) finds that officials of the United States and representatives of the United Nations Panel of Experts established pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 (2009), which monitors and facilitates implementation of United Nations sanctions on North Korea, "agree that the lack of detailed reports from all member states is an impediment to the UN's effective implementation of its sanctions"; and

    * (B) notes that "many member states lack the technical capacity to enforce sanctions and prepare reports" on the implementation of United Nations sanctions on North Korea.
