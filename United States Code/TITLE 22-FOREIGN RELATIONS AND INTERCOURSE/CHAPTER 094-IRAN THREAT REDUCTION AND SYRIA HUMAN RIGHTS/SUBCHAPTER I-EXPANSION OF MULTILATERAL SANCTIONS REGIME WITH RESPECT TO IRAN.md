### SUBCHAPTER I—EXPANSION OF MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME WITH RESPECT TO IRAN

### §8711. Sense of Congress on enforcement of multilateral sanctions regime and expansion and implementation of sanctions laws
* It is the sense of Congress that the goal of compelling Iran to abandon efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons capability and other threatening activities can be effectively achieved through a comprehensive policy that includes economic sanctions, diplomacy, and military planning, capabilities and options, and that this objective is consistent with the one stated by President Barack Obama in the 2012 State of the Union Address: "Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal". Among the economic measures to be taken are—

  * (1) prompt enforcement of the current multilateral sanctions regime with respect to Iran;

  * (2) full, timely, and vigorous implementation of all sanctions enacted into law, including sanctions imposed or expanded by this Act or amendments made by this Act, through—

    * (A) intensified monitoring by the President and the designees of the President, including the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and senior officials in the intelligence community (as defined in section 401a(4) of title 50), as appropriate;

    * (B) more extensive use of extraordinary authorities provided for under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and other sanctions laws;

    * (C) reallocation of resources to provide the personnel necessary, within the Department of the Treasury, the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce, and, where appropriate, the intelligence community, to apply and enforce sanctions; and

    * (D) expanded cooperation with international sanctions enforcement efforts;


  * (3) urgent consideration of the expansion of existing sanctions with respect to such areas as—

    * (A) the provision of energy-related services to Iran;

    * (B) the provision of insurance and reinsurance services to Iran;

    * (C) the provision of shipping services to Iran; and

    * (D) those Iranian financial institutions not yet designated for the imposition of sanctions that may be acting as intermediaries for Iranian financial institutions that are designated for the imposition of sanctions; and


  * (4) a focus on countering Iran's efforts to evade sanctions, including—

    * (A) the activities of telecommunications, Internet, and satellite service providers, in and outside of Iran, to ensure that such providers are not participating in or facilitating, directly or indirectly, the evasion of the sanctions regime with respect to Iran or violations of the human rights of the people of Iran;

    * (B) the activities of financial institutions or other businesses or government agencies, in or outside of Iran, not yet designated for the imposition of sanctions; and

    * (C) urgent and ongoing evaluation of Iran's energy, national security, financial, and telecommunications sectors, to gauge the effects of, and possible defects in, particular sanctions, with prompt efforts to correct any gaps in the existing sanctions regime with respect to Iran.

### §8712. Diplomatic efforts to expand multilateral sanctions regime
#### (a) Multilateral negotiations
* Congress urges the President to intensify diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate international fora such as the United Nations and bilaterally with allies of the United States, for the purpose of—

  * (1) expanding the United Nations Security Council sanctions regime to include—

    * (A) a prohibition on the issuance of visas to any official of the Government of Iran who is involved in—

      * (i) human rights violations in or outside of Iran;

      * (ii) the development of a nuclear weapons program and a ballistic missile capability in Iran; or

      * (iii) support by the Government of Iran for terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Hezbollah; and


    * (B) a requirement that each member country of the United Nations—

      * (i) prohibit the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines from landing at seaports, and cargo flights of Iran Air from landing at airports, in that country because of the role of those organizations in proliferation and illegal arms sales; and

      * (ii) apply the prohibitions described in clause (i) to other Iranian entities designated for the imposition of sanctions on or after August 10, 2012;


  * (2) expanding the range of sanctions imposed with respect to Iran by allies of the United States;

  * (3) expanding efforts to limit the development of petroleum resources and the importation of refined petroleum products by Iran;

  * (4) developing additional initiatives to—

    * (A) increase the production of crude oil in countries other than Iran; and

    * (B) assist countries that purchase or otherwise obtain crude oil or petroleum products from Iran to eliminate their dependence on crude oil and petroleum products from Iran; and


  * (5) eliminating the revenue generated by the Government of Iran from the sale of petrochemical products produced in Iran to other countries.

#### (b) Reports to Congress
* Not later than 180 days after August 10, 2012, and every 180 days thereafter, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the extent to which diplomatic efforts described in subsection (a) have been successful that includes—

  * (1) an identification of the countries that have agreed to impose sanctions or take other measures to further the policy set forth in subsection (a);

  * (2) the extent of the implementation and enforcement of those sanctions or other measures by those countries;

  * (3) the criteria the President uses to determine whether a country has significantly reduced its crude oil purchases from Iran pursuant to section 8513a(d)(4)(D) of this title, as amended by section 504, including considerations of reductions both in terms of volume and price;

  * (4) an identification of the countries that have not agreed to impose such sanctions or measures, including such countries granted exceptions for significant reductions in crude oil purchases pursuant to such section 8513a(d)(4)(D);

  * (5) recommendations for additional measures that the United States could take to further diplomatic efforts described in subsection (a); and

  * (6) the disposition of any decision with respect to sanctions imposed with respect to Iran by the World Trade Organization or its predecessor organization.
