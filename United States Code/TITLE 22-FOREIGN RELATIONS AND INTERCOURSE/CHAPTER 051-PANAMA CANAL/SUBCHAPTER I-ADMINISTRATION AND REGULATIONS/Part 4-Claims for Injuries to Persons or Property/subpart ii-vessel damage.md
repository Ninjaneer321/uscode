### SUBPART II—VESSEL DAMAGE

### §3771. Injuries in locks of canal; adjustment and payment of claims
* (a) Subject to section 3779(b) of this title and to subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall promptly adjust and pay damages for injuries to vessels, or to the cargo, crew, or passengers of vessels, which may arise by reason of their passage through the locks of the Panama Canal when the injury was proximately caused by negligence or fault on the part of an officer or employee of the United States acting within the scope of his employment and in the line of his duties in connection with the operation of the Canal. If the negligence or fault of the vessel, master, crew, or passengers proximately contributed to the injury, the award of damages shall be diminished in proportion to the negligence or fault attributable to the vessel, master, crew, or passengers. Damages may not be allowed and paid for injuries to any protrusion beyond any portion of the hull of a vessel, whether it is permanent or temporary in character. A vessel is considered to be passing through the locks of the Canal, under the control of officers or employees of the United States, from the time the first towing line is made fast on board before entrance into the locks and until the towing lines are cast off upon, or immediately prior to, departure from the lock chamber. No payment for damages on a claim may be made under this section unless the claim is filed with the Commission within one year after the date of the injury or by November 18, 1998, whichever is later.

* (b)(1) With respect to a claim under subsection (a) for damages for injuries to a vessel or its cargo, if, at the time the injuries were incurred, the navigation or movement of the vessel was not under the control of a Panama Canal pilot, the Commission may pay not more than $50,000 on the claim, unless the injuries were caused by another vessel under the control of a Panama Canal pilot.

* (2) The provisions of subsections (c) through (e) of section 3761 of this title shall apply to any claim described in paragraph (1).

### §3772. Injuries outside locks
* Subject to section 3779(b) of this title, the Commission shall promptly adjust and pay damages for injuries to vessels, or to the cargo, crew, or passengers of vessels which may arise by reason of their presence in the Panama Canal, or waters adjacent thereto, other than the locks, when the injury was proximately caused by negligence or fault on the part of an officer or employee of the United States acting within the scope of his employment and in the line of his duties in connection with the operation of the Canal. If the negligence or fault of the vessel, master, crew, or passengers proximately contributed to the injury, the award of damages shall be diminished in proportion to the negligence or fault attributable to the vessel, master, crew, or passengers. In the case of a vessel which is required by or pursuant to regulations prescribed pursuant to section 3811 of this title to have a Panama Canal pilot on duty aboard, damages may not be adjusted and paid for injuries to the vessel, or its cargo, crew, or passengers, incurred while the vessel was underway and in motion, unless at the time the injuries were incurred the navigation or movement of the vessel was under the control of a Panama Canal pilot. No payment for damages on a claim may be made under this section unless the claim is filed with the Commission within one year after the date of the injury or by November 18, 1998, whichever is later.

### §3773. Measure of damages generally
* In determining the amount of the award of damages for injuries to a vessel for which the Commission is determined to be liable, there may be included—

  * (1) the actual or estimated cost of repairs;

  * (2) charter hire actually lost by the owners, or charter hire actually paid, depending upon the terms of the charter party, for the time the vessel is undergoing repairs;

  * (3) maintenance of the vessel and wages of the crew, if they are found to be actual additional expenses or losses incurred outside of the charter hire; and

  * (4) other expenses which are definitely and accurately shown to have been incurred necessarily and by reason of the accident or injuries.


* Agent's fees, or commissions, or other incidental expenses of similar character, or any items which are indefinite, indeterminable, speculative, or conjectural may not be allowed. The Commission shall be furnished such vouchers, receipts, or other evidence as may be necessary in support of any item of a claim. If a vessel is not operated under charter but by the owner directly, evidence shall be secured if available as to the sum for which vessels of the same size and class can be chartered in the market. If the charter value cannot be determined, the value of the vessel to its owners in the business in which it was engaged at the time of the injuries shall be used as a basis for estimating the damages for the vessel's detention; and the books of the owners showing the vessel's earnings about the time of the accident or injuries shall be considered as evidence of probable earnings during the time of detention. If the books are unavailable, such other evidence shall be furnished as may be necessary.

### §3774. Delays for which no responsibility is assumed
* The Commission is not responsible, and may not consider any claim, for demurrage or delays caused by—

  * (1) landslides or other natural causes;

  * (2) necessary construction or maintenance work on Canal locks, terminals, or equipment;

  * (3) obstruction arising from accidents;

  * (4) time necessary for admeasurement;

  * (5) congestion of traffic;

  * (6) investigation of a marine accident that is conducted within 24 hours after the accident occurs, except that any liability of the Commission beyond that 24-hour period shall be limited to the extent to which the accident was caused, or contributed to, by the negligence of an employee of the Commission acting within the scope of the employee's official duties; or

  * (7) except as specially set forth in this subpart, any other cause.

### §3775. Settlement of claims
* The Commission, by mutual agreement, compromise, or otherwise, may adjust and determine the amounts of the respective awards of damages pursuant to this subpart. Such amounts may be paid only out of money allotted for the maintenance and operation of the Panama Canal. Acceptance by a claimant of the amount awarded to him shall be deemed to be in full settlement of such claim against the Government of the United States.

### §3776. Actions on claims
* Subject to section 3779(b) of this title, a claimant for damages pursuant to section 3771(a) or 3772 of this title who considers himself aggrieved by the findings, determination, or award of the Commission in reference to his claim may bring an action on the claim against the Commission in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Subject to the provisions of this part and of applicable regulations issued pursuant to section 3811 of this title relative to navigation of the Panama Canal and adjacent waters, such actions shall proceed and be heard by the court without a jury according to the principles of law and rules of practice obtaining generally in like cases between a private party and a department or agency of the United States. Any judgment obtained against the Commission in an action under this subpart may be paid only out of money allotted for the maintenance and operation of the Panama Canal. An action for damages cognizable under this section shall not otherwise lie against the United States or the Commission, nor in any other court, than as provided in this section; nor may it lie against any officer or employee of the United States or of the Commission. Any action on a claim under this section shall be barred unless the action is brought within 180 days after the date on which the Commission mails to the claimant written notification of the Commission's final determination with respect to the claim or by May 17, 1998, whichever is later. Attorneys appointed by the Commission shall represent the Commission in any action arising under this subpart.

### §3777. Investigation of accident or injury giving rise to claim
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a claim may not be considered under this subpart, or an action for damages lie thereon, unless, prior to the departure from the Panama Canal of the vessel involved—

  * (1) an investigation of the accident or injury giving rise to the claim has been completed, which shall include a hearing by the Board of Local Inspectors of the Commission; and

  * (2) the basis for the claim has been laid before the Commission.

### §3778. Board of local inspectors
* (a) The President shall provide for the establishment of a Board of Local Inspectors of the Panama Canal Commission which shall perform, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the President—

  * (1) the investigations required by section 3777 of this title; and

  * (2) such other duties with respect to marine matters as may be assigned by the President.


* (b) In conducting any investigation pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Board of Local Inspectors established pursuant to such subsection may summon witnesses, administer oaths, and require the production of books and papers necessary for such investigation.

### §3779. Insurance
* (a) The Commission is authorized to purchase insurance to protect the Commission against major and unpredictable revenue losses or expenses arising from catastrophic marine accidents or other unpredictable events.

* (b)(1) The Commission may by regulation require as a condition of transit through the Panama Canal or presence in the Panama Canal or waters adjacent thereto that any potential claimant under section 3771 or 3772 of this title be covered by insurance against the types of injuries described in those sections. The amount of insurance so required shall be specified in those regulations, but may not exceed $1,000,000.

* (2) In a claim under section 3771 or 3772 of this title for which the Commission has required insurance under this subsection, the Commission's liability shall be limited to the amount of damages in excess of the amount of insurance required by the Commission.

* (3) In regulations under this subsection, the Commission may prohibit consideration or payment by it of claims presented by or on behalf of an insurer or subrogee of a claimant in a case for which the Commission has required insurance under this subsection.
