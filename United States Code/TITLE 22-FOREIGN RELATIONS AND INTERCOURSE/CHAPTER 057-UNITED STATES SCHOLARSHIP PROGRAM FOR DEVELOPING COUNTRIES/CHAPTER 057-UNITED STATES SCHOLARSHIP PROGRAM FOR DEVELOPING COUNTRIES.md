### **CHAPTER 57—UNITED STATES SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES**

### §4701. Statement of purpose
* The purpose of this chapter is to establish an undergraduate scholarship program designed to bring students of limited financial means from developing countries to the United States for study at United States institutions of higher education.

### §4702. Congressional findings and declaration of policy
* The Congress finds and declares that—

  * (1) it is in the national interest for the United States Government to provide a stable source of financial support to give students in developing countries the opportunity to study in the United States, in order to improve the range and quality of educational alternatives, increase mutual understanding, and build lasting links between those countries and the United States;

  * (2) providing scholarships to foreign students to study in the United States has proven over time to be an effective means of creating strong bonds between the United States and the future leadership of developing countries and, at the same time, assists countries substantially in their development efforts;

  * (3) study in United States institutions by foreign students enhances trade and economic relationships by providing strong English language skills and establishing professional and business contacts;

  * (4) students from families of limited financial means have, in the past, largely not had the opportunity to study in the United States, and scholarship programs sponsored by the United States have made no provision for identifying, preparing, or supporting such students for study in the United States;

  * (5) it is essential that the United States citizenry develop its knowledge and understanding of the developing countries and their languages, cultures, and socioeconomic composition as these areas assume an ever larger role in the world community;

  * (6) an undergraduate scholarship program for students of limited financial means from developing countries to study in the United States would complement current assistance efforts in the areas of advanced education and training of people of developing countries in such disciplines as are required for planning and implementation of public and private development activities;

  * (7) the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America has recommended a program of 10,000 United States Government-sponsored scholarships to bring Central American students to the United States, which program would involve careful targeting to encourage participation by young people from all social and economic classes, would maintain existing admission standards by providing intensive English and other training, and would encourage graduates to return to their home countries after completing their education; and

  * (8) it is also in the interest of the United States, as well as peaceful cooperation in the Western Hemisphere, that particular attention be given to the students of the Caribbean region.

### §4703. Scholarship program authority
#### (a) In general
* The President, acting through the United States Information Agency, shall provide scholarships (including partial assistance) for undergraduate study at United States institutions of higher education by citizens and nationals of developing countries who have completed their secondary education and who would not otherwise have an opportunity to study in the United States due to financial limitations.

#### (b) Form of scholarship; forgiveness of loan repayment
* To encourage students to use their training in their countries of origin, each scholarship pursuant to this section shall be in the form of a loan with all repayment to be forgiven upon the student's prompt return to his or her country of origin for a period which is at least one year longer than the period spent studying in the United States. If the student is granted asylum in the United States pursuant to section 1158 of title 8 or is admitted to the United States as a refugee pursuant to section 1157 of title 8, half of the repayment shall be forgiven.

#### (c) Consultation
