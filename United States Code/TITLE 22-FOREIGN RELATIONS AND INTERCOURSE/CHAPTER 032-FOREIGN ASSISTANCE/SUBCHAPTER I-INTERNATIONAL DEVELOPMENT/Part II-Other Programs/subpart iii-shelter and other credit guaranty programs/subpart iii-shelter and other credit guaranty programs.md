### SUBPART III—SHELTER AND OTHER CREDIT GUARANTY PROGRAMS

### §2181. Policy
* The Congress recognizes that shelter, including essential urban development services, is among the most fundamental of human needs. Shelter for most people in the developing countries consists largely of domestic materials assembled by local labor. While recognizing that most financing for such shelter must come from domestic resources, the Congress finds that carefully designed programs involving United States capital and expertise can increase the availability of domestic financing for improved shelter and related services for low-income people by demonstrating to local entrepreneurs and institutions that providing low-cost shelter can be financially viable. The Congress reaffirms, therefore, that the United States should continue to assist developing countries in marshalling resources for low-cost shelter. Particular attention should be given to programs which will support pilot projects for low-cost shelter or which will have a maximum demonstration impact on local institutions and national policy. The Congress declares that the long run goal of all such programs should be to develop domestic construction capabilities and to stimulate local credit institutions to make available domestic capital and other management and technological resources required for effective low-cost shelter programs and policies.

### §2182. Authorization for worldwide shelter guarantees
#### (a) Authorization to issue guarantees to eligible investors
* To carry out the policy of section 2181 of this title, the President is authorized to issue guaranties to eligible investors (as defined in section 2198(c) of this title) assuring against losses incurred in connection with loans made for projects meeting the criteria set forth in section 2181 of this title. The total principal amount of guaranties issued under this subpart or heretofore issued under prior housing guaranty authorities, which are outstanding at any one time, shall not exceed $2,558,000,000. The authority of this section shall continue through September 30, 1992. The President may issue regulations from time to time with regard to the terms and conditions upon which such guaranties shall be issued and the eligibility of lenders.

#### (b) Emphasis on certain activities
* Activities carried out under this section shall emphasize—

  * (1) projects which provide improved home sites to poor families on which to build shelter, and related services;

  * (2) projects comprised of expandable core shelter units on serviced sites;

  * (3) slum upgrading projects designed to conserve and improve existing shelter;

  * (4) shelter projects for low-income people designed for demonstration or institution building purposes; and

  * (5) community facilities and services in support of projects authorized under this section to improve the shelter occupied by the poor.

#### (c) Use of solar energy technology
* In issuing guaranties under this section with respect to projects in a country which require the use or conservation of energy, the President shall give consideration to the use of solar energy technologies, where such technologies are economically and technically feasible. Technologies which may be used include solar hot water systems, solar heating and cooling, passive solar heating, biomass conversion, photovoltaic and wind applications, and community-scale solar thermal applications.

#### (k) Minimum annual program levels
* The total principal amount of guaranties issued under this section for each of the fiscal years 1986 and 1987 shall be comparable to the total principal amount of such guaranties issued for fiscal year 1984, subject to the dollar limitations on the issuance of guaranties under this section which are contained in subsection (a) and in appropriation Acts.

Agricultural credit and assistance for self-help community development projects should include, but not be limited to, material and such projects as wells, pumps, farm machinery, improved seed, fertilizer, pesticides, vocational training, food industry development, nutrition projects, improved breeding stock for farm animals, sanitation facilities, and looms and other handicraft aids.

In the event that less than the full amount authorized to be issued under subsection (b) of this section is issued in such period, the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall be available in the fiscal year ending on September 30, 1998.

#### (b) Fiscal year levels
* The President is authorized to issue guarantees in furtherance of the purposes of this section. Subject to subsection (d), the total principal amount of guarantees which may be issued by the President under this section shall be up to $10,000,000,000 which may be issued as follows:

  * (1) in fiscal year 1993, up to $2,000,000,000 may be issued on October 1, 1992 or thereafter;

  * (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "appropriate congressional committees" means the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.

#### (c) Use of guarantees
* Guarantees may be issued under this section only to support activities in the geographic areas which were subject to the administration of the Government of Israel before June 5, 1967.

#### (d) Limitation on guarantee amount
* The amount of authorized but unissued guarantees that the President is authorized to issue as specified in subsection (b) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount extended or estimated to have been extended by the Government of Israel during the previous year for activities which the President determines are inconsistent with the objectives of this section or understandings reached between the United States Government and the Government of Israel regarding the implementation of the loan program. The President shall submit a report to Congress no later than September 30 of each fiscal year during the pendency of the program specifying the amount calculated under this subsection and that will be deducted from the amount of guarantees authorized to be issued in the next fiscal year.

#### (e) Fees
* (1) Fees charged for the loan guarantee program under this section each year shall be an aggregate annual origination fee equal to the estimated subsidy cost of the guarantees issued under this section for that year, calculated by the Office of Management and Budget for the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.]. This shall also include an amount for the administrative expenses of the Agency for International Development in administering the program under this section. All such fees shall be paid by the Government of Israel to the Government of the United States. Funds made available for Israel under part 4 of subchapter II of this chapter, may be utilized by the Government of Israel to pay such fees to the United States Government. No further appropriations of subsidy cost are needed for the loan guarantee authorized hereunder for fiscal year 1993 and the four succeeding fiscal years.

* (2) The origination fee shall be payable to the United States Government on a pro rata basis as each guarantee for each loan or increment is issued.

#### (f) Authority to suspend
* Except as provided in subsections (l) and (m) of this section, the President shall determine the terms and conditions for issuing guarantees. If the President determines that these terms and conditions have been breached, the President may suspend or terminate the provision of all or part of the additional loan guarantees not yet issued under this section. Upon making such a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.

#### (g) Procedures for suspension or termination
* Any suspension or termination pursuant to subsection (f) shall be in accordance with the following procedures:

  * (2) Such a suspension or termination shall cease to be effective if Congress enacts, within 30 days of submission, a joint resolution authorizing the assistance notwithstanding the suspension.

  * (3) Any such joint resolution shall be considered in the Senate in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976.

  * (4) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions under this subsection, a motion to proceed to the consideration of any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the appropriate committee shall be treated as highly privileged in the House of Representatives.

  * (5) In the event that the President suspends the provision of additional loan guarantees under subsection (f) and Congress does not enact a joint resolution pursuant to this subsection, the provision of additional loan guarantees under the program established by this section may be resumed only if the President determines and so reports to Congress that the reasons for the suspension have been resolved or that the resumption is otherwise in the national interest.

#### (h) Economic context
* The effective absorption of immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia within the private sector requires large investment and economic restructuring to promote market efficiency and thereby contribute to productive employment and sustainable growth. Congress recognizes that the Government of Israel is developing an economic strategy designed to achieve these goals, and that the Government of Israel intends to adopt a comprehensive, multi-year economic strategy based on prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Congress also recognizes that these policies are being designed to reduce direct involvement of the government in the economic system and to promote private enterprise, important prerequisites for economic stability and sustainable growth.

#### (i) Consultations
* It is the sense of the Congress that, as agreed between the two Governments and in order to further the policies specified in subsection (h), Israel and the United States should continue to engage in consultations concerning economic and financial measures, including structural and other reforms, that Israel should undertake during the pendency of this program to enable its economy to absorb and resettle immigrants and to accommodate the increased debt burden that will result from loans guaranteed pursuant to this section. It is the sense of the Congress that these consultations on economic measures should address progress and plans in the areas of budget policies, privatization, trade liberalization, financial and capital markets, labor markets, competition policy, and deregulation.

#### (j) Goods and services
* During the pendency of the loan program authorized under this section, it is anticipated that, in the context of the economic reforms undertaken pursuant to subsections (h) and (i) of this section, Israel's increased population due to its absorption of immigrants, and the liberalization by the Government of Israel of its trade policy with the United States, the amount of United States investment goods and services purchased for use in or with respect to the country of Israel will substantially increase.

#### (k) Reports
* The President shall report to Congress by December 31 of each fiscal year until December 31, 1999, regarding the implementation of this section.

#### (l) Applicability of certain sections
* Section 2183 of this title shall apply to guarantees issued under subsection (a) in the same manner as such section applies to guarantees issued under section 2182 of this title, except that subsections (a), (e)(1), (g), and (j) of section 2183 of this title shall not apply to such guarantees and except that, to the extent section 2183 of this title is inconsistent with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], that Act shall apply. Loans shall be guaranteed under this section without regard to sections 2181, 2182, and 2198(c) of this title. Notwithstanding section 2183(f) of this title, the interest rate for loans guaranteed under this section may include a reasonable fee to cover the costs and fees incurred by the borrower in connection with this program or financing under this section in the event the borrower elects not to finance such costs or fees out of loan principal. Guarantees once issued hereunder shall be unconditional and fully and freely transferable.

#### (m) Terms and conditions
* (1) Each loan guarantee issued under this section shall guarantee 100 percent of the principal and interest payable on such loans.

* (2) The standard terms of any loan or increment guaranteed under this section shall be 30 years with semiannual payments of interest only over the first 10 years, and with semiannual payments of principal and interest on a level payment basis, over the last 20 years thereof, except that the guaranteed loan or any increments issued in a single transaction may include obligations having different maturities, interest rates, and payment terms if the aggregate scheduled debt service for all obligations issued in a single transaction equals the debt service for a single loan or increment of like amount having the standard terms described in this sentence. The guarantor shall not have the right to accelerate any guaranteed loan or increment or to pay any amounts in respect of the guarantees issued other than in accordance with the original payment terms of the loan. For purposes of determining the maximum principal amount of any loan or increment to be guaranteed under this section, the principal amount of each such loan or increment shall be—

  * (A) in the case of any loan issued on a discount basis, the original issue price (excluding any transaction costs) thereof; or

  * (B) in the case of any loan issue on an interest-bearing basis, the stated principal amount thereof.
