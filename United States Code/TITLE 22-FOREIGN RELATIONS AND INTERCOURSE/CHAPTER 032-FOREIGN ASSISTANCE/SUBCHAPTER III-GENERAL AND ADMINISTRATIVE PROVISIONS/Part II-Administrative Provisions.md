  * (I) analyze ways in which decisions on providing development assistance can involve more of the people of the recipient countries;

  * (K) recommend standards that should be set for "graduating" recipient countries from United States development assistance;

  * (L) analyze whether United States development assistance should be used as a means to achieve United States foreign policy objectives;

  * (M) analyze how the United States can evaluate the performance of its development assistance programs not only against economic indicators, but in other ways, including how to measure the success of United States development assistance in democratization efforts; and evaluate the existing foreign assistance framework to ascertain the degree of coordination, or lack thereof, of the disparate foreign development programs as administered by the various Federal agencies, to identify and assess the redundancies of programs and organizational structures engaged in foreign assistance, and to recommend revisions to authorizing legislation for foreign assistance that would seek to reconcile competing foreign policy and foreign aid goals; and
