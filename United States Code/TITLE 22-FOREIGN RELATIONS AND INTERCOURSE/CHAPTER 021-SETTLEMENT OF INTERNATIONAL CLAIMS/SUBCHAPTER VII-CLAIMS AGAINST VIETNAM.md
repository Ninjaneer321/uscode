* The amount of any claim covered by subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall be calculated on the basis of the total loss suffered by the corporation, association, or other entity, with respect to which the claim is made, and shall bear the same proportion to such loss as the ownership interest of the claimant at the time of loss bears to the entire ownership interest thereof.

### §1645e. Offsets

### §1645f. Certifications; assigned claims
* (a) The Commission shall certify to each claimant who files a claim under this subchapter the amount determined by the Commission to be the loss suffered by the claimant which is covered by this subchapter. The Commission shall certify to the Secretary of State such amount and the basic information underlying that amount, together with a statement of the evidence relied upon and the reasoning employed in making that determination.

* (b) In any case in which a claim under this subchapter is assigned by purchase before the Commission determines the amount due on that claim, the amount so determined shall not exceed the amount of actual consideration paid by the last such assignee.

### §1645g. Consolidated awards
* With respect to any claim under section 1645b of this title which, at the time of the award, is vested in persons other than the person by whom the original loss was sustained, the Commission shall issue a consolidated award in favor of all claimants then entitled to the award, which award shall indicate the respective interests of such claimants in the award, and all such claimants shall participate, in proportion to their indicated interests, in any payments that may be made under this subchapter in all respects as if the award had been in favor of a single person.
