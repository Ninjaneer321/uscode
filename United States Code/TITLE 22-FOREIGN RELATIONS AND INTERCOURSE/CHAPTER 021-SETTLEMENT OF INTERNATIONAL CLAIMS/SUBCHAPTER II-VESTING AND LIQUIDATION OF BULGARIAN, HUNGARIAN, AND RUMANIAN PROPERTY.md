* In accordance with article 25 of the treaty of peace with Bulgaria, article 29 of the treaty of peace with Hungary, and article 27 of the treaty of peace with Rumania, any property which was blocked in accordance with Executive Order 8389 of April 10, 1940, as amended, and remains blocked on August 9, 1955, and which, as of September 15, 1947, was owned directly or indirectly by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania or by any national thereof as defined in such Executive order, shall vest in such officer or agency as the President may from time to time designate and shall vest when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee shall direct. Such property shall be sold or otherwise liquidated as expeditiously as possible after vesting under such rules and regulations as the President or his designee may prescribe. The net proceeds remaining upon completion of the administration and liquidation thereof, including the adjudication of any suits or claims with respect thereto under sections 1631f and 1631g of this title, shall be covered into the Treasury. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, any such property determined by the President or his designee to be owned directly by a natural person shall not be vested under this subsection but shall remain blocked subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe. If, at any time within one year from the date of the vesting of any property under this subsection, the President or his designee shall determine that it was directly owned at the date of vesting by a natural person, then the President or his designee shall divest such property and restore it to its blocked status prior to vesting, subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe, or if such property has been liquidated, shall divest the net proceeds thereof and carry them in blocked accounts with the Treasury, bearing no interest, in the name of the owner thereof at the date of vesting, subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe.

#### (b) Net proceeds of property vested in Alien Property Custodian or Attorney General

#### (c) Determination of ownership by natural person of vested property
* The determination under this section that any vested property was not directly owned by a natural person at the date of vesting shall be within the sole discretion of the President or his designee and shall not be subject to review by any court.

### §1631b. Cancellation and issuance of shares of stock or other beneficial interest in corporation
* Whenever shares of stock or other beneficial interest in any corporation, association, or company or trust are vested in any officer or agency designated by the President under this subchapter, it shall be the duty of the corporation, association, or company or trustee or trustees issuing such shares or any certificates or other instruments representing the same or any other beneficial interest to cancel such shares of stock or other beneficial interest upon its, his, or their books and in lieu thereof to issue certificates or other instruments for such shares or other beneficial interest to the designee of the President, or otherwise as such designee shall require.

### §1631c. Filing of order of conveyance
* Any vesting order, or other order or requirement issued pursuant to this subchapter, or a duly certified copy thereof, may be filed, registered, or recorded in any office for the filing, registering, or recording of conveyances, transfers, or assignments of such property as may be covered by such order or requirement; and if so filed, registered, or recorded shall impart the same notice and have the same force and effect as a duly executed conveyance, transfer, or assignment so filed, registered, or recorded.

### §1631d. Acquittance and discharge of obligation
* Any payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery of property made to the President or his designee pursuant to this subchapter, or any rule, regulation, instruction, or direction issued under this subchapter, shall to the extent thereof be a full acquittance and discharge for all purposes of the obligation of the person making the same; and no person shall be held liable in any court for or in respect of any such payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery made in good faith in pursuance of and in reliance on the provisions of this subchapter, or of any rule, regulation, instruction, or direction issued thereunder.

### §1631f. Claims to vested property
#### (a) Action for return of property; jurisdiction; complaint; custody of property until final determination
* Any person who has not filed a notice of claim under subsection (b) of this section may institute a suit in equity for the return of any property, or the net proceeds thereof, vested in a designee of the President pursuant to section 1631a(a) of this title and held by such designee. Such suit, to which said designee shall be made a party defendant, shall be instituted in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the district in which the claimant resides, or, if a corporation, where it has its principal place of business, by the filing of a complaint which alleges—

  * (1) that the claimant is a person other than Bulgaria, Hungary, or Rumania, or a national thereof as defined in Executive Order 8389 of April 10, 1940, as amended; and

  * (2) that the claimant was the owner of such property immediately prior to its vesting, or is the successor in interest of such owner by inheritance, devise, or bequest.


* If the court finds in favor of the claimant, it shall order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of such property, or the net proceeds thereof, held by said designee or the portion thereof to which the court shall determine said claimant is entitled. If suit shall be so instituted, then such property, or, if liquidated, the net proceeds thereof, shall be retained in the custody of said designee until any final judgment or decree which shall be entered in favor of the claimant shall be fully satisfied, or until final judgment or decree shall be entered against the claimant or suit otherwise terminated.

#### (b) Notice of claim; review of denial
* Any person who has not instituted a suit under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section may file a notice of claim under oath for the return of any property, or the net proceeds thereof, vested in a designee of the President pursuant to section 1631a(a) of this title and held by such designee. Such notice of claim shall be filed with said designee and in such form and containing such particulars as said designee shall require. Said designee may return any property so claimed, or the net proceeds thereof, whenever he shall determine—

  * (1) that the claimant is a person other than Bulgaria, Hungary, or Rumania, or a national thereof as defined in Executive Order 8389 of April 10, 1940, as amended; and

  * (2) that the claimant was the owner of such property immediately prior to its vesting, or is the successor in interest of such owner by inheritance, devise, or bequest.


* Any person whose claim is finally denied in whole or in part by said designee may obtain review of such denial by filing a petition therefor in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Such petition for review must be filed within sixty days after the date of mailing of the final order of denial by said designee and a copy shall forthwith be transmitted to the said designee by the clerk of the court. Within forty-five days after receipt of such petition for review, or within such further time as the court may grant for good cause shown, said designee shall file an answer thereto, and shall file with the court the record of the proceedings with respect to such claim, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The court may enter judgment affirming the order of the designee; or, upon finding that such order is not in accordance with law or that any material findings upon which such order is based are unsupported by substantial evidence, may enter judgment modifying or setting aside the order in whole or in part, and (1) directing a return of all or part of the property claimed, or (2) remanding the claim for further administrative proceedings thereon. If a notice of claim is filed under this subsection, the property which is the subject of such claim, or, if liquidated, the net proceeds thereof, shall be retained in the custody of said designee until any final order of said designee or any final judgment or decree which shall be entered in favor of the claimant shall be fully satisfied, or until a final order of said designee or a final judgment or decree shall be entered against the claimant, or the claim or suit otherwise terminated.

#### (c) Exclusiveness of relief
* The sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to any property vested pursuant to section 1631a(a) of this title, except a person claiming under section 1631o of this title, shall be that provided by the terms of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, and in the event of the liquidation by sale or otherwise of such property, shall be limited to and enforced against the net proceeds received therefrom and held by the designee of the President. The claim of any person based on his ownership of shares of stock or other proprietary interest in a corporation which was the owner of property at the date of vesting thereof under section 1631a(a) of this title shall be allowable under subsection (a) or (b) of this section if 25 per centum or more of the outstanding capital stock or other proprietary interest in the corporation was owned at such date by nationals of countries other than Bulgaria, Hungary, Rumania, Germany, or Japan. But no such claim of a national of a foreign country shall be satisfied except after certification by the Department of State that the country of the national accords protection to nationals of the United States in similar types of cases.

#### (d) Recovery for conservation, preservation or maintenance of property
* The designee of the President may retain or recover from any property, or the net proceeds thereof, returned pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section an amount not exceeding that expended or incurred by him for the conservation, preservation, or maintenance of such property or proceeds.

### §1631g. Payment of debts
#### (a) Claims allowable; defenses
* Any property vested in the designee of the President pursuant to section 1631a(a) of this title, or the net proceeds thereof, shall be equitably applied by such designee in accordance with this section to the payment of debts owed by the person who owned such property immediately prior to its vesting in such designee. No debt claim shall be allowed under this section—

  * (1) if it is asserted against Bulgaria, Hungary, or Rumania (including the government or any political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities thereof); or

  * (2) if it is based upon an obligation expressed or payable in any currency other than the currency of the United States; or

  * (3) if it was not due and owing—

    * (A) on October 9, 1940, in the event the property in respect of which such debt claim is filed was owned immediately prior to vesting by a national of Rumania;

    * (B) on March 4, 1941, in the event the property in respect of which such debt claim is filed was owned immediately prior to vesting by a national of Bulgaria; or

    * (C) on March 13, 1941, in the event that the property in respect of which such debt claim is filed was owned immediately prior to vesting by a national of Hungary.


* Any defense to the payment of such claim which would have been available to the debtor shall be available to the designee, except that the period from and after December 7, 1941, shall not be included for the purpose of determining the applicability of any statute of limitations. Debt claims allowable under this section shall include only those of natural persons who were citizens of the United States at the dates their debtors became obligated to them; those of other natural persons who are and have been continuously since December 7, 1941, residents of the United States; those of corporations organized under the laws of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia; and those acquired by the designee of the President under this subchapter. Successors in interest by inheritance, devise, bequest, or operation of law of debt claimants, other than persons who would themselves be disqualified hereunder from allowance of a debt claim, shall be eligible for payment to the same extent as their principals or predecessors would have been.

#### (b) Time limit for filing claims; extension; notice
* The designee of the President under this subchapter shall fix a date or dates after which the filing of debt claims in respect of any or all debtors shall be barred, and may extend the time so fixed, and shall give at least sixty days' notice thereof by publication in the Federal Register. In no event shall the time extend beyond the expiration of one year from the date of the last vesting in the designee of the President of any property of a debtor in respect to whose debts the date is fixed. No debt shall be paid prior to the expiration of one hundred and twenty days after publication of the first such notice in respect of the debtor, nor in any event shall any payment of a debt claim be made out of any property or proceeds in respect of which a suit or proceeding for return pursuant to this subchapter is pending.

#### (c) Examination of claims; finality of determination
* The designee shall examine the claims, and such evidence in respect thereof as may be presented to him or as he may introduce into the record, and shall make a determination, with respect to each claim, of allowance or disallowance, in whole or in part. The determination of the designee that a claim is within either paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review, and such claim shall not be considered a debt claim for any purpose under this section.

#### (d) Fund for debt payments
* Payment of debt claims shall be made only out of such money included in, or received as net proceeds from the sale, use, or other disposition of, any property owned by the debtor immediately prior to its vesting in the designee of the President, as shall remain after deduction of (1) the amount of the expenses of the designee (including both expenses in connection with such property or proceeds thereof, and such portion as the designee shall fix of his other expenses), and of taxes, as defined in section 1631k of this title, paid by the designee in respect of such property or proceeds; and (2) such amount, if any, as the designee may establish as a cash reserve for the future payment of such expenses and taxes. If the money available hereunder for the payment of debt claims against the debtor is insufficient for the satisfaction of all claims allowed by the designee, ratable payments shall be made in accordance with subsection (g) of this section to the extent permitted by the money available and additional payments shall be made whenever the designee shall determine that substantial further money has become available, through liquidation of any such property or otherwise. The designee shall not be required, through any judgment of any court, levy of execution, or otherwise, to sell or liquidate any property vested in him, for the purpose of paying or satisfying any debt claim.

#### (e) Amount payable; disallowance; notice; review; additional evidence; judgment
* If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed does not exceed the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, payment may be made, the designee shall pay each claim to the extent allowed, and shall serve by registered mail, on each claimant whose claim is disallowed in whole or in part, a notice of such disallowance. Within sixty days after the date of mailing of the designee's determination, any debt claimant whose claim has been disallowed in whole or in part may file in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia a complaint for review of such disallowance naming the designee as defendant. Such complaint shall be served on the designee. The designee, within forty-five days after service on him, shall certify and file in said court a transcript of the record of proceedings with respect to the claim in question. Upon good cause shown such time may be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claim as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been presented to the designee or introduced into the record by him, and the determination of the designee with respect thereto, including any findings made by him. The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the designee, or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to him. The court shall enter judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the designee's determination, and directing payment in the amount, if any, which it finds due.

#### (f) Schedule of debt claims allowed; notice; review; additional evidence; intervention; judgment
* If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed exceeds the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, payment may be made, the designee shall prepare and serve by registered mail on all claimants a schedule of all debt claims allowed and the proposed payment to each claimant. In preparing such schedule, the designee shall assign priorities in accordance with subsection (g) of this section. Within sixty days after the date of mailing of such schedule, any claimant considering himself aggrieved may file in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia a complaint for review of such schedule, naming the designee as defendant. A copy of such complaint shall be served upon the designee and on each claimant named in the schedule. The designee within forty-five days after service on him, shall certify and file in said court a transcript of the record of proceedings with respect to such schedule. Upon good cause shown such time may be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claims in question as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been presented to the designee or introduced into the record by him, any findings or other determinations made by the designee with respect thereto, and the schedule prepared by the designee. The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the designee or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to him. Any interested debt claimant who has filed a claim with the designee pursuant to this section, upon timely application to the court, shall be permitted to intervene in such review proceedings. The court shall enter judgment affirming or modifying the schedule as prepared by the designee and directing payment, if any be found due, pursuant to the schedule as affirmed or modified and to the extent of the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, payment may be made. Pending the decision of the court on such complaint for review, and pending final determination of any appeal from such decision, payment may be made only to an extent, if any, consistent with the contentions of all claimants for review.

#### (g) Priority of claims
* Debt claims shall be paid in the following order of priority: (1) Wage and salary claims, not to exceed $600; (2) claims entitled to priority under sections 3713(a) and 9309 of title 31, except as provided in subsection (h) of this section; (3) all other claims for services rendered; for expenses incurred in connection with such services, for rent, for goods and materials delivered to the debtor, and for payments made to the debtor for goods or services not received by the claimant; (4) all other debt claims. No payment shall be made to claimants within a subordinate class unless the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, payment may be made permits payment in full of all allowed claims in every prior class.

#### (h) Priority as debt due United States
* No debt of any kind shall be entitled to priority under any law of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, solely by reason of becoming a debt due or owing to the United States as a result of its acquisition by the designee of the President under this subchapter.

#### (i) Exclusiveness of relief
* The sole relief and remedy available to any person seeking satisfaction of a debt claim out of any property vested in the designee under section 1631a(a) of this title, or the proceeds thereof, shall be the relief and remedy provided in this section, and suits for the satisfaction of debt claims shall not be instituted, prosecuted, or further maintained except in conformity with this section. No person asserting any interest, right, or title in any property or proceeds acquired by the designee shall be barred from proceeding pursuant to this subchapter for the return thereof, by reason of any proceeding which he may have brought pursuant to this section; nor shall any security interest asserted by the creditor in any such property or proceeds be deemed to have been waived solely by reason of such proceeding. Nothing contained in this section shall bar any person from the prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against the original debtor or against any other person who may be liable for the payment of any debt for which a claim might have been filed hereunder. No purchaser, lessee, licensee, or other transferee of any property from the designee shall, solely by reason of such purchase, lease, license, or transfer, become liable for the payment of any debt owed by the person who owned such property prior to its vesting in the designee. Payment by the designee to any debt claimant shall constitute, to the extent of payment, a discharge of the indebtedness represented by the claim.

### §1631h. Hearings on claims; rules and regulations; delegation of powers
* The officer or agency designated by the President under this subchapter to entertain claims under sections 1631f(b) and 1631g of this title shall have power to hold such hearings as may be deemed necessary; to prescribe rules and regulations governing the form and contents of claims, the proof thereof, and all other matters related to proceedings on such claims; and in connection with such proceedings to issue subpenas, administer oaths, and examine witnesses. Such powers, and any other powers conferred upon such officer or agency by sections 1631f(b) and 1631g of this title may be exercised through subordinate officers designated by such officer or agency.

### §1631i. Limitations
* No suit may be instituted pursuant to section 1631f(a) of this title after the expiration of one year from the date of vesting of the property in respect of which relief is sought. No return may be made pursuant to section 1631f(b) of this title unless notice of claim has been filed within one year from the date of vesting of the property in respect of which the claim is filed.

### §1631j. Fees of agents, attorneys, or representatives
* No property or proceeds shall be returned under this subchapter, nor shall any payment be made or judgment awarded in respect of any property vested in any officer or agency designated by the President under this subchapter unless satisfactory evidence is furnished to said designee, or the court, as the case may be, that the aggregate of the fees to be paid to all agents, attorneys at law or in fact, or representatives, for services rendered in connection with such return or payment or judgment does not exceed 10 per centum of the value of such property or proceeds or of such payment. Any agent, attorney at law or in fact, or representative, believing that the aggregate of the fees should be in excess of such 10 per centum may, in the case of any return of, or the making of any payment in respect of, such property or proceeds by the President or such officer or agency as he may designate, petition the district court of the United States for the district in which he resides for an order authorizing fees in excess of 10 per centum and shall name such officer or agency as respondent. The court hearing such petition or a court awarding any judgment in respect of any such property or proceeds, as the case may be, shall approve an aggregate of fees in excess of 10 per centum of the value of such property or proceeds only upon a finding that there exist special circumstances of unusual hardship which require the payment of such excess. Any person accepting any fee in excess of an amount approved under this section, or retaining for more than thirty days any portion of a fee, accepted prior to such approval, in excess of the fee as approved, shall be guilty of a violation of this subchapter.

### §1631k. Taxes
#### (a) Liability
* The vesting in any officer or agency designated by the President under this subchapter of any property or the receipt by such designee of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall not render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax for any period before or after such vesting.

#### (b) Payment by designee; liability of former owner; enforcement of tax liability; transfer of property
* The officer or agency designated by the President under this subchapter shall, notwithstanding the filing of any claim or the institution of any suit under this subchapter, pay any tax incident to any such property, or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not contrary to the interest of the United States. The former owner shall not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property, earnings, increment, or proceeds are held by such designee, unless they are returned pursuant to this subchapter without payment of such tax by the designee. Every such tax shall be paid by the designee to the same extent, as nearly as may be deemed practicable, as though the property had not been vested, and shall be paid only out of the property, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or out of other property acquired from the same former owner, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be enforced from any property or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof while held by the designee except with his consent. Where any property is transferred, otherwise than pursuant to section 1631f(a) or 1631f(b) of this title, the designee may transfer the property free and clear of any tax, except to the extent of any lien for a tax existing and perfected at the date of vesting, and the proceeds of such transfer shall, for tax purposes, replace the property in the hands of the designee.

#### (c) Computation; suspension of limitations
* Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the manner of computing any Federal taxes, including without limitation by reason of this enumeration, the applicability in such computation of credits, deductions, and exemptions to which the former owner is or would be entitled, and the time and manner of any payment of such taxes and the extent of any compliance by the designee with provisions of Federal law and regulations applicable with respect to Federal taxes, shall be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to effectuate this section. Statutes of limitations on assessments, collection, refund, or credit of Federal taxes shall be suspended with respect to any vested property or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, while vested and for six months thereafter; but no interest shall be paid upon any refund with respect to any period during which the statute of limitations is so suspended.

#### (d) "Tax" defined
* The word "tax" as used in this section shall include, without limitation by reason of this enumeration, any property, income, excess-profits, war-profits, excise, estate, and employment tax, import duty, and special assessment; and also any interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition thereto not arising from any act, omission, neglect, failure, or delay on the part of the designee.

### §1631_l_. Determination of expenses and time for filing suit, notice of claim and debt claim
* Prior to covering the net proceeds of liquidation of any property into the Treasury pursuant to section 1631a(a) of this title, the designee of the President under this subchapter shall determine—

  * (1) the amount of his administrative expenses attributable to the performance of his functions under this subchapter with respect to such property and the proceeds thereof. The amount so determined, together with an amount not exceeding that expended or incurred for the conservation, preservation, or maintenance of such property and the proceeds thereof, and for taxes in respect of same, shall be deducted and retained by the designee from the proceeds otherwise covered into the Treasury; and

  * (2) that the time for the institution of a suit under section 1631f(a) of this title, for the filing of a notice of claim under section 1631f(b) of this title, and for the filing of debt claims under section 1631g of this title has elapsed.


* The determinations of the designee under this section shall be final and conclusive.

### §1631m. Lien, attachment, garnishment, etc., of transferred property
* No property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the designee of the President under this subchapter, or the net proceeds thereof, shall be liable to lien, attachment, garnishment, trustee process, or execution, or subject to any order or decree of any court, except as provided in this subchapter.

### §1631n. Penalties
* Whoever shall willfully violate any provision of this subchapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder, and whoever shall willfully violate, neglect, or refuse to comply with any order of the President or of a designee of the President under this subchapter, issued in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter shall be fined not more than $5,000, or, if a natural person, imprisoned for not more than five years, or both; and the officer, director, or agent of any corporation who knowingly participates in such violation shall be punished by a like fine, imprisonment, or both.

### §1631_o_. Eligibility for return of interest in property
#### (a) Persons eligible; determination; prerequisites
* Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or any provision of the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended, any person (1) who was formerly a national of Bulgaria, Hungary, or Rumania, and (2) who, as a consequence of any law, decree, or regulation of the nation of which he was a national discriminating against political, racial or religious groups, at no time between December 7, 1941, and the time when such law, decree, or regulation was abrogated enjoyed full rights of citizenship under the law of such nation, shall be eligible hereunder to receive the return of his interest in property which was vested under section 1631a(a) of this title or under the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended [50 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.], as the property of a corporation organized under the laws of Bulgaria, Hungary, or Rumania if 25 per centum or more of the outstanding capital stock of such corporation was owned at the date of vesting by such persons and nationals of countries other than Bulgaria, Hungary, Rumania, Germany, or Japan, or if such corporation was subjected after December 7, 1941, under the laws of its country, to special wartime measures directed against it because of the enemy character of some or all of its stockholders; and no certificate by the Department of State as provided under section 1631f(c) of this title shall be required for such persons.

#### (b) Notice of claim; time of claim; fund for payment
* An interest in property vested under the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended, as the property of a corporation organized under the laws of Bulgaria, Hungary, or Rumania shall be subject to return under subsection (a) of this section only if a notice of claim for the return of any such interest has been timely filed under the provisions of section 4330 of Title 50, provided that application may be made therefore within six months after July 24, 1968. In the event such interest has been liquidated and the net proceeds thereof transferred to the Bulgarian Claims Fund, Hungarian Claims Fund, or Rumanian Claims Fund, the net proceeds of any other interest representing vested property held in the United States Treasury may be used for the purpose of making the return hereunder.

#### (c) Finality of determination
* Determinations by the designee of the President or any other officer or agency with respect to claims under this section, including the allowance or disallowance thereof, shall be final and shall not be subject to review by any court.
