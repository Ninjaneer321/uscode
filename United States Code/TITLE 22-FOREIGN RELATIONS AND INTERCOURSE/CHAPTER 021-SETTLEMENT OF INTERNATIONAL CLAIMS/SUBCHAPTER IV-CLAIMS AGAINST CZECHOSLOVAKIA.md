In making the determination with respect to the validity and amount of claims and value of properties, rights, or interests taken, the Commission is authorized to accept the fair or proved value of the said property, right, or interest as of a time when the property or business enterprise taken, was last operated, used, managed or controlled by the national or nationals of the United States asserting the claim irrespective of whether such date is prior to the actual date of nationalization or taking by the Government of Czechoslovakia.

### §1642d. Nationality requirements
* A claim under section 1642c of this title shall not be allowed unless the property upon which the claim is based was owned by a national of the United States on the date of nationalization or other taking thereof and unless the claim has been held by a national of the United States continuously thereafter until the date of filing with the Commission.

### §1642e. Claims based on ownership interest in corporations or other legal entities

#### (c) Indirect ownership
* A claim under section 1642c of this title, based upon an indirect ownership interest in a corporation, association, or other entity for loss by reason of the nationalization or other taking of such corporation, association, or other entity, or the property thereof, shall be allowed, subject to other provisions of this subchapter, only if at least 25 per centum of the entire ownership interest thereof at the time of such nationalization or other taking was vested in nationals of the United States.

#### (d) Computation of award
* Any award on a claim under subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall be calculated on the basis of the total loss suffered by such corporation, association, or other entity, and shall bear the same proportion to such loss as the ownership interest of the claimant bears to the entire ownership interest thereof.

### §1642f. Prevention of double benefits
* In determining the amount of any award by the Commission there shall be deducted all amounts the claimant has received from any source on account of the same loss or losses with respect to which such award is made.

### §1642g. Consolidated awards

* (2) Thereafter, payments from time to time on account of the unpaid balance of each remaining award made pursuant to this subchapter which shall bear to such unpaid balance the same proportion as the total amount in the fund available for distribution at the time such payments are made bears to the aggregate unpaid balance of all such awards.

#### (b) Regulations
* Such payments, and applications for such payments, shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe.

#### (e) Partial payments
* Subject to the provisions of any claims agreement hereafter concluded between the Governments of Czechoslovakia and the United States, payment of any award pursuant to this subchapter shall not, unless such payment is for the full amount of the claim, as determined by the Commission to be valid, with respect to which the award is made, extinguish such claim, or be construed to have divested any claimant, or the United States on his behalf, of any rights against any foreign government for the unpaid balance of his claim.
