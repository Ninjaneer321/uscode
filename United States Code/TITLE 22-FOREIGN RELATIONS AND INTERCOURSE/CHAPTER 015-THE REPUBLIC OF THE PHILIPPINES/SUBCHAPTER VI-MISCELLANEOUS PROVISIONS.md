* (g)(1) The Philippine Government shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, at the end of each calendar quarter, all of the moneys received during such quarter from export taxes (less refunds), imposed and collected in accordance with the provisions of this section, and said moneys shall be deposited in an account with the Treasurer of the United States and shall constitute a supplementary sinking fund for the payment of bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress: _Provided, however_, That moneys received from any export tax imposed on any article which is shipped from the Philippines to the United States prior to July 4, 1946, and which is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after July 4, 1946, shall be refunded by the independent Government of the Philippines.

* (2) The said Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to accept the deposits of the proceeds of the export taxes referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection in accordance with section 1333 of this title.

* (3) The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, with the approval of the Philippine Government, is authorized to purchase with such supplementary sinking-fund bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress and to invest such fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Whenever the Secretary of the Treasurer finds that such fund is in excess of an amount adequate to meet future interest and principal payments on all such bonds, he may, with the approval of the Philippine Government, purchase with such excess any other bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, municipalities, and instrumentalities. For the purpose of this subsection obligations may be acquired on original issue at par, or by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. Any obligations acquired by the fund may, with the approval of the Philippine Government, be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market price and the proceeds of such sale and the proceeds of the payment upon maturity or redemption of any obligations held in the supplementary sinking fund, as well as all moneys in any manner earned by such fund or on any obligations acquired by said fund, shall be paid into the said fund.

* (4) During the three months preceding July 4, 1946, the Philippine Government and the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall confer to ascertain that portion of the bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress, which will remain outstanding on July 4, 1946; and the Philippine Government shall turn over to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for destruction all such bonds that are then held, canceled, or uncanceled, in any of the sinking funds maintained for the payment of such bonds. After such outstanding portion of this indebtedness is thus determined, and before July 4, 1946, (i) there shall be set up with the Treasurer of the United States a special trust account in the name of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to pay future interest and principal payments on such bonds; (ii) the Philippine Government shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for deposit in this special trust account all of the sinking funds maintained for the payment of such bonds; and (iii) the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall transfer into this special trust account all of the proceeds of the supplementary sinking fund referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection. Any portion of such special trust account found by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States on July 4, 1946, to be in excess of an amount adequate to meet future interest and principal payments on all such outstanding bonds shall be turned over to the Treasury of the independent Government of the Philippines to be set up as an additional sinking fund to be used for the purpose of liquidating and paying all other obligations of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, municipalities, and instrumentalities. To the extent that such special trust account is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to be insufficient to pay interest and principal on the outstanding bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress, the Philippine Government shall, on or before July 3, 1946, pay to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for deposit in such special trust account an amount which said Secretary of the Treasury determines is required to assure payment of principal and interest on such bonds: _Provided, however_, That if the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States finds that this requirement would impose an undue hardship upon the Philippines, then the Philippine Government shall continue to provide annually the necessary funds for the payment of interest and principal on such bonds until such time as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States determines that the amount in the special trust account is adequate to meet interest and principal payments on such bonds.

* (5) On and after July 4, 1946, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is authorized, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, to purchase at the market price for the special trust account bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is also authorized, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, to invest all or any part of such special trust account in any interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in any obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Such obligations may be acquired on original issue at the issue price or by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price, and any obligations acquired by the special trust account may, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market price, and the proceeds of the payment upon maturity or redemption of such obligations shall be held as a part of such special trust account. Whenever the special trust account is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to be adequate to meet interest and principal payments on all outstanding bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to pay from such trust account the principal of such outstanding bonds and to pay all interest due and owing on such bonds. All such bonds and interest coupons paid or purchased by the special trust account shall be canceled and destroyed by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. From time to time after July 4, 1946, any moneys in such special trust account found by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to be in excess of an amount adequate to meet interest and principal payments on all such bonds shall be turned over to the treasurer of the independent Government of the Philippines.
