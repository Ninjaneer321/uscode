### SUBCHAPTER I—UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE

### §6811. Coordinated donor strategy for support and education of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa
#### (a) Statement of policy
* It is in the national interest of the United States to assist in mitigating the burden that will be placed on sub-Saharan African social, economic, and political institutions as these institutions struggle with the consequences of a dramatically increasing AIDS orphan population, many of whom are themselves infected by HIV and living with AIDS. Effectively addressing that burden and its consequences in sub-Saharan Africa will require a coordinated multidonor strategy.

#### (b) Development of strategy
* The President shall coordinate the development of a multidonor strategy to provide for the support and education of AIDS orphans and the families, communities, and institutions most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.

#### (c) Definition
* In this section, the term "HIV/AIDS" means, with respect to an individual, an individual who is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes the acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), or living with AIDS.

### §6812. African crisis response initiative and HIV/AIDS training
#### (a) Findings

  * (4) it is in the interests of the United States to assist the countries of Africa in combating the spread of HIV/AIDS.

#### (b) Education on the prevention of the spread of AIDS
* In undertaking education and training programs for military establishments in African countries, the United States shall ensure that classroom training under the African Crisis Response Initiative includes military-based education on the prevention of the spread of AIDS.
