### SUBCHAPTER II—UNITED STATES INITIATIVES TO STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL SAFEGUARDS SYSTEM

### §3241. Congressional declaration of policy
* The United States is committed to continued strong support for the principles of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to a strengthened and more effective International Atomic Energy Agency and to a comprehensive safeguards system administered by the Agency to deter proliferation. Accordingly, the United States shall seek to act with other nations to—

  * (a) continue to strengthen the safeguards program of the IAEA and, in order to implement this section, contribute funds, technical resources, and other support to assist the IAEA in effectively implementing safeguards;

  * (b) ensure that the IAEA has the resources to carry out the provisions of Article XII of the Statute of the IAEA;

  * (c) improve the IAEA safeguards system (including accountability) to ensure—

    * (1) the timely detection of a possible diversion of source or special nuclear materials which could be used for nuclear explosive devices;

    * (2) the timely dissemination of information regarding such diversion; and

    * (3) the timely implementation of internationally agreed procedures in the event of such diversion;


  * (d) ensure that the IAEA receives on a timely basis the data needed for it to administer an effective and comprehensive international safeguards program and that the IAEA provides timely notice to the world community of any evidence of a violation of any safeguards agreement to which it is a party; and

  * (e) encourage the IAEA, to the maximum degree consistent with the Statute, to provide nations which supply nuclear materials and equipment with the data needed to assure such nations of adherence to bilateral commitments applicable to such supply.

### §3242. Training program
* The Department of Energy, in consultation with the Commission, shall establish and operate a safeguards and physical security training program to be made available to persons from nations and groups of nations which have developed or acquired, or may be expected to develop or acquire, nuclear materials and equipment for use for peaceful purposes. Any such program shall include training in the most advanced safeguards and physical security techniques and technology, consistent with the national security interests of the United States.

### §3243. Negotiations
* The United States shall seek to negotiate with other nations and groups of nations to—

  * (1) adopt general principles and procedures, including common international sanctions, to be followed in the event that a nation violates any material obligation with respect to the peaceful use of nuclear materials and equipment or nuclear technology, or in the event that any nation violates the principles of the Treaty, including the detonation by a non-nuclear-weapon state of a nuclear explosive device; and

  * (2) establish international procedures to be followed in the event of diversion, theft, or sabotage of nuclear materials or sabotage of nuclear facilities, and for recovering nuclear materials that have been lost or stolen, or obtained or used by a nation or by any person or group in contravention of the principles of the Treaty.

### §3244. Actions to combat international nuclear terrorism
#### (a) Actions to be taken by President
* The Congress hereby directs the President—

  * (1) to seek universal adherence to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material;

  * (2) to—

    * (A) conduct a review, enlisting the participation of all relevant departments and agencies of the Government, to determine whether the recommendations on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material published by the International Atomic Energy Agency are adequate to deter theft, sabotage, and the use of nuclear facilities and materials in acts of international terrorism, and

    * (B) transmit the results of this review to the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency;


  * (3) to take, in concert with United States allies and other countries, such steps as may be necessary—

    * (A) to keep to a minimum the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material in international transit, and

    * (B) to ensure that when any such material is transported internationally, it is under the most effective means for adequately protecting it from acts or attempted acts of sabotage or theft by terrorist groups or nations; and


  * (4) to seek agreement in the United Nations Security Council to establish—

    * (A) an effective regime of international sanctions against any nation or subnational group which conducts or sponsors acts of international nuclear terrorism, and

    * (B) measures for coordinating responses to all acts of international nuclear terrorism, including measures for the recovery of stolen nuclear material and the clean-up of nuclear releases.
