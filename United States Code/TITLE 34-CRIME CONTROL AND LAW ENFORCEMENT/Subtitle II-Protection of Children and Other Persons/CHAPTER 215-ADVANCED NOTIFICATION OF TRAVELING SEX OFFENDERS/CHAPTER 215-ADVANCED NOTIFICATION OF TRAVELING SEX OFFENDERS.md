### **CHAPTER 215—ADVANCED NOTIFICATION OF TRAVELING SEX OFFENDERS**

### §21501. Findings
* Congress finds the following:

  * (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, he had been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child.

  * (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104–145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities.

  * (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally.

  * (5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The International Labour Organization has estimated that 1,8000,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and pornography each year.

  * (6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where commercial, child sex trafficking.
