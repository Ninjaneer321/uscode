### SUBPART 2—REENTRY RESEARCH

### §60551. Offender reentry research
#### (a) National Institute of Justice
* The National Institute of Justice may conduct research on juvenile and adult offender reentry, including—

  * (1) a study identifying the number and characteristics of minor children who have had a parent incarcerated, and the likelihood of such minor children becoming adversely involved in the criminal justice system some time in their lifetime;

  * (2) a study identifying a mechanism to compare rates of recidivism (including rearrest, violations of parole, probation, post-incarceration supervision, and reincarceration) among States; and

  * (3) a study on the population of offenders released from custody who do not engage in recidivism and the characteristics (housing, employment, treatment, family connection) of that population.

#### (b) Bureau of Justice Statistics
* The Bureau of Justice Statistics may conduct research on offender reentry, including—

  * (1) an analysis of special populations (including prisoners with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, female offenders, juvenile offenders, offenders with limited English proficiency, and the elderly) that present unique reentry challenges;

  * (2) studies to determine which offenders are returning to prison, jail, or a juvenile facility and which of those returning offenders represent the greatest risk to victims and community safety;

  * (3) annual reports on the demographic characteristics of the population reentering society from prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities;

  * (4) a national recidivism study every 3 years;

  * (5) a study of parole, probation, or post-incarceration supervision violations and revocations; and

  * (6) a study concerning the most appropriate measure to be used when reporting recidivism rates (whether rearrest, reincarceration, or any other valid, evidence-based measure).

### §60552. Grants to study parole or post-incarceration supervision violations and revocations
#### (a) Grants authorized
* From amounts made available to carry out this section, the Attorney General may make grants to States to study and to improve the collection of data with respect to individuals whose parole or post-incarceration supervision is revoked, and which such individuals represent the greatest risk to victims and community safety.

#### (b) Application
* As a condition of receiving a grant under this section, a State shall—

  * (1) certify that the State has, or intends to establish, a program that collects comprehensive and reliable data with respect to individuals described in subsection (a), including data on—

    * (A) the number and type of parole or post-incarceration supervision violations that occur with the State;

    * (B) the reasons for parole or post-incarceration supervision revocation;

    * (C) the underlying behavior that led to the revocation; and

    * (D) the term of imprisonment or other penalty that is imposed for the violation; and


  * (2) provide the data described in paragraph (1) to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in a form prescribed by the Bureau.

#### (c) Analysis
* Any statistical analysis of population data under this section shall be conducted in accordance with the Federal Register Notice dated October 30, 1997, relating to classification standards.

### §60553. Addressing the needs of children of incarcerated parents
#### (a) Best practices
* #### (1) In general
  * From amounts made available to carry out this section, the Attorney General may collect data and develop best practices of State corrections departments and child protection agencies relating to the communication and coordination between such State departments and agencies to ensure the safety and support of children of incarcerated parents (including those in foster care and kinship care), and the support of parent-child relationships between incarcerated (and formerly incarcerated) parents and their children, as appropriate to the health and well-being of the children.

* #### (2) Contents
  * The best practices developed under paragraph (1) shall include information related to policies, procedures, and programs that may be used by States to address—

    * (A) maintenance of the parent-child bond during incarceration;

    * (B) parental self-improvement; and

    * (C) parental involvement in planning for the future and well-being of their children.

* Not later than 1 year after the development of best practices described in subsection (a), the Attorney General shall disseminate to States and other relevant entities such best practices.

#### (c) Sense of Congress
* It is the sense of Congress that States and other relevant entities should use the best practices developed and disseminated in accordance with this section to evaluate and improve the communication and coordination between State corrections departments and child protection agencies to ensure the safety and support of children of incarcerated parents (including those in foster care and kinship care), and the support of parent-child relationships between incarcerated (and formerly incarcerated) parents and their children, as appropriate to the health and well-being of the children.

### §60555. Authorization of appropriations for research
