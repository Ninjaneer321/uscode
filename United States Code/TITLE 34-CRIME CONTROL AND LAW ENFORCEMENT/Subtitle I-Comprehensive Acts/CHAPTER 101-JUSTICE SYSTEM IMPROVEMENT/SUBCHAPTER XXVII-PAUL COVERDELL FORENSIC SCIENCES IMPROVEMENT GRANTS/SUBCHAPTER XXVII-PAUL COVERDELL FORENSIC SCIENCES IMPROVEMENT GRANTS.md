### §10563. Allocation
#### (a) In general
* #### (1) Population allocation
  * Eighty-five percent of the amount made available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year shall be allocated to each State that meets the requirements of section 10562 of this title so that each State shall receive an amount that bears the same ratio to the 85 percent of the total amount made available to carry out this subchapter for that fiscal year as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.

* #### (2) Discretionary allocation
  * Fifteen percent of the amount made available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year shall be allocated pursuant to the Attorney General's discretion for competitive awards to States and units of local government. In making awards under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall consider the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by each State to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 most recent calendar years for which data is available and consider the existing resources and current needs of the potential grant recipient.

* #### (3) Minimum requirement
  * Each State shall receive not less than 1 percent of the amount made available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year.

* #### (4) Proportional reduction
  * If the amounts available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year are insufficient to pay in full the total payment that any State is otherwise eligible to receive under paragraph (3), then the Attorney General shall reduce payments under paragraph (1) for such payment period to the extent of such insufficiency. Reductions under the preceding sentence shall be allocated among the States (other than States whose payment is determined under paragraph (3)) in the same proportions as amounts would be allocated under paragraph (1) without regard to paragraph (3).

#### (b) State defined
* In this section, the term "State" means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, except that—

  * (1) for purposes of the allocation under this section, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be considered as 1 State; and

  * (2) for purposes of paragraph (1), 67 percent of the amount allocated shall be allocated to American Samoa, and 33 percent shall be allocated to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

  * (3) To train, assist, and employ forensic laboratory personnel and medicolegal death investigators, as needed, to eliminate such a backlog.

  * (4) To address emerging forensic science issues (such as statistics, contextual bias, and uncertainty of measurement) and emerging forensic science technology (such as high throughput automation, statistical software, and new types of instrumentation).

  * (5) To educate and train forensic pathologists.

#### (d) Administrative costs
* Not more than 10 percent of the total amount of a grant awarded under this subchapter may be used for administrative expenses.

#### (e) Backlog defined
* For purposes of this section, a backlog in the analysis of forensic science evidence exists if such evidence—

  * (1) has been stored in a laboratory, medical examiner's office, coroner's office, law enforcement storage facility, or medical facility; and
