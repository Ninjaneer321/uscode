### §2343. Matters relating to the international materials protection, control, and accounting program of the Department of Energy
#### (a) Radiological dispersal device materials protection, control, and accounting
* The Secretary of Energy may establish within the International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting program of the Department of Energy a program on the protection, control, and accounting of materials usable in radiological dispersal devices. In establishing such program, the Secretary shall—

  * (1) identify the sites and radiological materials to be covered by such program;

  * (2) carry out a risk assessment of such radiological materials; and

  * (3) identify and establish the costs of and schedules for such program.

#### (b) Revised focus for materials protection, control, and accounting program of Russian Federation
* (1) The Secretary of Energy shall work cooperatively with the Russian Federation to develop, as soon as practicable but not later than January 1, 2018, a sustainable nuclear materials protection, control, and accounting system for the nuclear materials of the Russian Federation that is supported solely by the Russian Federation.

* (2) The Secretary shall work with the Russian Federation to identify various alternatives to provide the United States adequate transparency in the nuclear materials protection, control, and accounting program of the Russian Federation to assure that such program is meeting applicable goals for nuclear materials protection, control, and accounting.

#### (c) Amount for activities
* Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by section 3101(a)(2) for the Department of Energy for the National Nuclear Security Administration for defense nuclear nonproliferation, up to $5,000,000 may be available for carrying out this section.

### §2344. Strengthened international security for nuclear materials and security of nuclear operations
#### (a) Report on options for international program to strengthen security
* (1) Not later than 270 days after December 2, 2002, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to Congress a report on options for an international program to develop strengthened security for nuclear reactors and associated materials outside the United States.

* (2) In evaluating options for purposes of the report, the Secretary shall consult with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency on the feasibility and advisability of actions to reduce the risks associated with terrorist attacks on nuclear reactors outside the United States.
