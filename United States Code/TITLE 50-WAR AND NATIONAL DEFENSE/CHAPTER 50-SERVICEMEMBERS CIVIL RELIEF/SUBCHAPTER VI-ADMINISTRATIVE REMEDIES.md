### SUBCHAPTER VI—ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

### §4011. Inappropriate use of chapter
* If a court determines, in any proceeding to enforce a civil right, that any interest, property, or contract has been transferred or acquired with the intent to delay the just enforcement of such right by taking advantage of this chapter, the court shall enter such judgment or make such order as might lawfully be entered or made concerning such transfer or acquisition.

### §4012. Certificates of service; persons reported missing
#### (a) Prima facie evidence
* In any proceeding under this chapter, a certificate signed by the Secretary concerned is prima facie evidence as to any of the following facts stated in the certificate:

  * (1) That a person named is, is not, has been, or has not been in military service.

  * (2) The time and the place the person entered military service.

  * (3) The person's residence at the time the person entered military service.

  * (4) The rank, branch, and unit of military service of the person upon entry.

  * (5) The inclusive dates of the person's military service.
