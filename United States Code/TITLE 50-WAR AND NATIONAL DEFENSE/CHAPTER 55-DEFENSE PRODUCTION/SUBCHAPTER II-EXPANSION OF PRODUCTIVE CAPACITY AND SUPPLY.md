#### (a) Expediting production and deliveries or services
* #### (1) Authorized activities
  * To reduce current or projected shortfalls of industrial resources, critical technology items, or essential materials needed for national defense purposes, subject to such regulations as the President may prescribe, the President may authorize a guaranteeing agency to provide guarantees of loans by private institutions for the purpose of financing any contractor, subcontractor, provider of critical infrastructure, or other person in support of production capabilities or supplies that are deemed by the guaranteeing agency to be necessary to create, maintain, expedite, expand, protect, or restore production and deliveries or services essential to the national defense.

* #### (2) Presidential determinations required
  * Except during a period of national emergency declared by Congress or the President, a loan guarantee may be entered into under this section only if the President determines that—

    * (B) without a loan guarantee, credit is not available to the loan applicant under reasonable terms or conditions sufficient to finance the activity;

    * (C) the loan guarantee is the most cost effective, expedient, and practical alternative for meeting the needs of the Federal Government;

    * (E) the loan to be guaranteed bears interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be reasonable, taking into account the then-current average yield on outstanding obligations of the United States with remaining periods of maturity comparable to the maturity of the loan;

    * (F) the loan agreement for the loan to be guaranteed provides that no provision of the loan agreement may be amended or waived without the consent of the fiscal agent of the United States for the guarantee; and

    * (G) the loan applicant has provided or will provide—

      * (i) an assurance of repayment, as determined by the President; and

#### (d) Aggregate guarantee amounts
* #### (1) Industrial resource and critical technology shortfalls
  * #### (A) In general
    * If the making of any guarantee or obligation of the Federal Government under this subchapter relating to a domestic industrial base shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all guarantees for such shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such guarantee may be made only—

      * (i) if the President has notified the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives in writing of the proposed guarantee; and
