#### (b) Authorization of appropriations
* There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $1,000,000.

### §167_o_. Low-Btu gas separation and helium conservation
#### (a) Authorization
* The Secretary of Energy shall support programs of research, development, commercial application, and conservation (including the programs described in subsection (b))—

  * (1) to expand the domestic production of low-Btu gas and helium resources;

  * (2) to separate and capture helium from natural gas streams; and

  * (3) to reduce the venting of helium and helium-bearing low-Btu gas during natural gas exploration and production.

#### (b) Programs
* #### (1) Membrane technology research
  * The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other appropriate agencies, shall support a civilian research program to develop advanced membrane technology that is used in the separation of low-Btu gases, including technologies that remove helium and other constituent gases that lower the Btu content of natural gas.

* #### (2) Helium separation technology
  * The Secretary of Energy shall support a research program to develop technologies for separating, gathering, and processing helium in low concentrations that occur naturally in geological reservoirs or formations, including—

    * (A) low-Btu gas production streams; and

    * (B) technologies that minimize the atmospheric venting of helium gas during natural gas production.

* #### (3) Industrial helium program
  * The Secretary of Energy, working through the Advanced Manufacturing Office of the Department of Energy, shall carry out a research program—

    * (A) to develop low-cost technologies and technology systems for recycling, reprocessing, and reusing helium for all medical, scientific, industrial, commercial, aerospace, and other uses of helium in the United States, including Federal uses; and

    * (B) to develop industrial gathering technologies to capture helium from other chemical processing, including ammonia processing.

#### (c) Authorization of appropriations
* There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $3,000,000.

### §167p. Helium-3 separation
#### (a) Interagency cooperation
* The Secretary shall cooperate with the Secretary of Energy, or a designee, on any assessment or research relating to the extraction and refining of the isotope helium-3 from crude helium and other potential sources, including—

  * (1) gas analysis; and

  * (2) infrastructure studies.

#### (b) Feasibility study
* The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, or a designee, may carry out a study to assess the feasibility of—

  * (1) establishing a facility to separate the isotope helium-3 from crude helium; and

  * (2) exploring other potential sources of the isotope helium-3.

#### (c) Report
* Not later than 1 year after October 2, 2013, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives a report that contains a description of the results of the assessments conducted under this section.

#### (d) Authorization of appropriations
* There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $1,000,000.

### §167q. Federal agency helium acquisition strategy
* In anticipation of the implementation of Phase D described in section 167d(d) of this title, and not later than 2 years after October 2, 2013, the Secretary (in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the National Science Foundation, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and other agencies as appropriate) shall submit to Congress a report that provides for Federal users—

  * (1) an assessment of the consumption of, and projected demand for, crude and refined helium;

  * (2) a description of a 20-year Federal strategy for securing access to helium;

  * (3) a determination of a date prior to September 30, 2021, for the implementation of Phase D as described in section 167d(d) of this title that minimizes any potential supply disruptions for Federal users;

  * (4) an assessment of the effects of increases in the price of refined helium and methods and policies for mitigating any determined effects; and

  * (5) a description of a process for prioritization of uses that accounts for diminished availability of helium supplies that may occur over time.
