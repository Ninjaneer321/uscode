  * (13) A description of the activities to be carried out under the program during that five-year period and a description of how the program will be prioritized relative to other defense nuclear nonproliferation programs of the Administration during that five-year period to address the highest priority risks and requirements, as informed by the threat assessment carried out under paragraph (10).

  * (14) A description and assessment of activities to be carried out under the program during that five-year period that will be coordinated with other elements of the Department of Energy, with the Department of Defense, and with other Federal agencies, to maximize efficiency and avoid redundancies.

  * (15) A summary of the technologies and capabilities documented under section 2576(a) of this title.

  * (16) A summary of the assessments conducted under section 2576(b)(1) of this title.

### §2576. Information relating to certain defense nuclear nonproliferation programs
#### (a) Technologies and capabilities
* The Administrator shall document, for efforts that are not focused on basic research, the technologies and capabilities of the defense nuclear nonproliferation research and development program that—

  * (1) are transitioned to end users for further development or deployment; and

  * (2) are deployed.

#### (b) Assessments of status
* (1) In assessing projects under the defense nuclear nonproliferation research and development program or the defense nuclear nonproliferation and arms control program, the Administrator shall compare the status of each such project, including with respect to the final results of such project, to the baseline targets and goals established in the initial project plan of such project.

* (2) The Administrator may carry out paragraph (1) using a common template or such other means as the Administrator determines appropriate.
