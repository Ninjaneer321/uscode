### PART B—TRITIUM

### §2541. Tritium production program
#### (a) Establishment of program
* The Secretary of Energy shall establish a tritium production program that is capable of meeting the tritium requirements of the United States for nuclear weapons.

#### (b) Location of tritium production facility
* The Secretary shall locate any new tritium production facility of the Department of Energy at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina.

#### (c) In-reactor tests
* The Secretary may perform in-reactor tests of tritium target rods as part of the activities carried out under the commercial light water reactor program.

### §2542. Tritium recycling
#### (a) In general
* Except as provided in subsection (b), the following activities shall be carried out at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina:

  * (1) All tritium recycling for weapons, including tritium refitting.

  * (2) All activities regarding tritium formerly carried out at the Mound Plant, Ohio.

#### (b) Exception
* The following activities may be carried out at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico:

  * (1) Research on tritium.

  * (2) Work on tritium in support of the defense inertial confinement fusion program.

  * (3) Provision of technical assistance to the Savannah River Site regarding the weapons surveillance program.

### §2544. Modernization and consolidation of tritium recycling facilities
* The Secretary of Energy shall carry out activities at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, to—

  * (1) modernize and consolidate the facilities for recycling tritium from weapons; and

  * (2) provide a modern tritium extraction facility so as to ensure that such facilities have a capacity to recycle tritium from weapons that is adequate to meet the requirements for tritium for weapons specified in the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum.

### §2545. Procedures for meeting tritium production requirements
#### (a) Production of new tritium
* The Secretary of Energy shall produce new tritium to meet the requirements of the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum at the Tennessee Valley Authority Watts Bar or Sequoyah nuclear power plants consistent with the Secretary's December 22, 1998, decision document designating the Secretary's preferred tritium production technology.

#### (b) Support
* To support the method of tritium production set forth in subsection (a), the Secretary shall design and construct a new tritium extraction facility in the H-Area of the Savannah River Site, Aiken, South Carolina.

#### (c) Design and engineering development
* The Secretary shall—

  * (1) complete preliminary design and engineering development of the Accelerator Production of Tritium technology design as a backup source of tritium to the source set forth in subsection (a) and consistent with the Secretary's December 22, 1998, decision document; and

  * (2) make available those funds necessary to complete engineering development and demonstration, preliminary design, and detailed design of key elements of the system consistent with the Secretary's decision document of December 22, 1998.
