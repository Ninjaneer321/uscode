### TITLE V. VENUE

### Rule 18. Place of Prosecution and Trial
* Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed. The court must set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant, any victim, and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice.

### Rule 19. [Reserved]

### Rule 20. Transfer for Plea and Sentence
* (a) CONSENT TO TRANSFER. A prosecution may be transferred from the district where the indictment or information is pending, or from which a warrant on a complaint has been issued, to the district where the defendant is arrested, held, or present if:

  * (1) the defendant states in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere and to waive trial in the district where the indictment, information, or complaint is pending, consents in writing to the court's disposing of the case in the transferee district, and files the statement in the transferee district; and

  * (2) the United States attorneys in both districts approve the transfer in writing.


* (b) CLERK'S DUTIES. After receiving the defendant's statement and the required approvals, the clerk where the indictment, information, or complaint is pending must send the file, or a certified copy, to the clerk in the transferee district.

* (c) EFFECT OF A NOT GUILTY PLEA. If the defendant pleads not guilty after the case has been transferred under Rule 20(a), the clerk must return the papers to the court where the prosecution began, and that court must restore the proceeding to its docket. The defendant's statement that the defendant wished to plead guilty or nolo contendere is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant.

* (d) JUVENILES.

  * (1) _Consent to Transfer._ A juvenile, as defined in 18 U.S.C. §5031, may be proceeded against as a juvenile delinquent in the district where the juvenile is arrested, held, or present if:

    * (A) the alleged offense that occurred in the other district is not punishable by death or life imprisonment;

    * (B) an attorney has advised the juvenile;

    * (C) the court has informed the juvenile of the juvenile's rights—including the right to be returned to the district where the offense allegedly occurred—and the consequences of waiving those rights;

    * (D) the juvenile, after receiving the court's information about rights, consents in writing to be proceeded against in the transferee district, and files the consent in the transferee district;

    * (E) the United States attorneys for both districts approve the transfer in writing; and

    * (F) the transferee court approves the transfer.


  * (2) _Clerk's Duties._ After receiving the juvenile's written consent and the required approvals, the clerk where the indictment, information, or complaint is pending or where the alleged offense occurred must send the file, or a certified copy, to the clerk in the transferee district.

### Rule 21. Transfer for Trial
* (a) FOR PREJUDICE. Upon the defendant's motion, the court must transfer the proceeding against that defendant to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there.

* (b) FOR CONVENIENCE. Upon the defendant's motion, the court may transfer the proceeding, or one or more counts, against that defendant to another district for the convenience of the parties, any victim, and the witnesses, and in the interest of justice.

* (c) PROCEEDINGS ON TRANSFER. When the court orders a transfer, the clerk must send to the transferee district the file, or a certified copy, and any bail taken. The prosecution will then continue in the transferee district.

* (d) TIME TO FILE A MOTION TO TRANSFER. A motion to transfer may be made at or before arraignment or at any other time the court or these rules prescribe.
