### TITLE III. THE GRAND JURY, THE INDICTMENT, AND THE INFORMATION

### Rule 6. The Grand Jury
* (a) SUMMONING A GRAND JURY.

  * (1) _In General._ When the public interest so requires, the court must order that one or more grand juries be summoned. A grand jury must have 16 to 23 members, and the court must order that enough legally qualified persons be summoned to meet this requirement.

  * (2) _Alternate Jurors._ When a grand jury is selected, the court may also select alternate jurors. Alternate jurors must have the same qualifications and be selected in the same manner as any other juror. Alternate jurors replace jurors in the same sequence in which the alternates were selected. An alternate juror who replaces a juror is subject to the same challenges, takes the same oath, and has the same authority as the other jurors.


* (b) OBJECTION TO THE GRAND JURY OR TO A GRAND JUROR.

  * (1) _Challenges._ Either the government or a defendant may challenge the grand jury on the ground that it was not lawfully drawn, summoned, or selected, and may challenge an individual juror on the ground that the juror is not legally qualified.

  * (2) _Motion to Dismiss an Indictment._ A party may move to dismiss the indictment based on an objection to the grand jury or on an individual juror's lack of legal qualification, unless the court has previously ruled on the same objection under Rule 6(b)(1). The motion to dismiss is governed by 28 U.S.C. §1867(e). The court must not dismiss the indictment on the ground that a grand juror was not legally qualified if the record shows that at least 12 qualified jurors concurred in the indictment.


* (c) FOREPERSON AND DEPUTY FOREPERSON. The court will appoint one juror as the foreperson and another as the deputy foreperson. In the foreperson's absence, the deputy foreperson will act as the foreperson. The foreperson may administer oaths and affirmations and will sign all indictments. The foreperson—or another juror designated by the foreperson—will record the number of jurors concurring in every indictment and will file the record with the clerk, but the record may not be made public unless the court so orders.

* (d) WHO MAY BE PRESENT.

  * (1) _While the Grand Jury Is in Session._ The following persons may be present while the grand jury is in session: attorneys for the government, the witness being questioned, interpreters when needed, and a court reporter or an operator of a recording device.

  * (2) _During Deliberations and Voting._ No person other than the jurors, and any interpreter needed to assist a hearing-impaired or speech-impaired juror, may be present while the grand jury is deliberating or voting.


* (e) RECORDING AND DISCLOSING THE PROCEEDINGS.

  * (1) _Recording the Proceedings._ Except while the grand jury is deliberating or voting, all proceedings must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device. But the validity of a prosecution is not affected by the unintentional failure to make a recording. Unless the court orders otherwise, an attorney for the government will retain control of the recording, the reporter's notes, and any transcript prepared from those notes.

  * (2) _Secrecy._

    * (A) No obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with Rule 6(e)(2)(B).

    * (B) Unless these rules provide otherwise, the following persons must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury:

      * (i) a grand juror;

      * (ii) an interpreter;

      * (iii) a court reporter;

      * (iv) an operator of a recording device;

      * (v) a person who transcribes recorded testimony;

      * (vi) an attorney for the government; or

      * (vii) a person to whom disclosure is made under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) or (iii).


  * (3) _Exceptions._

    * (A) Disclosure of a grand-jury matter—other than the grand jury's deliberations or any grand juror's vote—may be made to:

      * (i) an attorney for the government for use in performing that attorney's duty;

      * (ii) any government personnel—including those of a state, state subdivision, Indian tribe, or foreign government—that an attorney for the government considers necessary to assist in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law; or

      * (iii) a person authorized by 18 U.S.C. §3322.


    * (B) A person to whom information is disclosed under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) may use that information only to assist an attorney for the government in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law. An attorney for the government must promptly provide the court that impaneled the grand jury with the names of all persons to whom a disclosure has been made, and must certify that the attorney has advised those persons of their obligation of secrecy under this rule.

    * (C) An attorney for the government may disclose any grand-jury matter to another federal grand jury.

    * (D) An attorney for the government may disclose any grand-jury matter involving foreign intelligence, counterintelligence (as defined in 50 U.S.C. §3003), or foreign intelligence information (as defined in Rule 6(e)(3)(D)(iii)) to any federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration, national defense, or national security official to assist the official receiving the information in the performance of that official's duties. An attorney for the government may also disclose any grand-jury matter involving, within the United States or elsewhere, a threat of attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or its agent, a threat of domestic or international sabotage or terrorism, or clandestine intelligence gathering activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by its agent, to any appropriate federal, state, state subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official, for the purpose of preventing or responding to such threat or activities.

      * (i) Any official who receives information under Rule 6(e)(3)(D) may use the information only as necessary in the conduct of that person's official duties subject to any limitations on the unauthorized disclosure of such information. Any state, state subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official who receives information under Rule 6(e)(3)(D) may use the information only in a manner consistent with any guidelines issued by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence.

      * (ii) Within a reasonable time after disclosure is made under Rule 6(e)(3)(D), an attorney for the government must file, under seal, a notice with the court in the district where the grand jury convened stating that such information was disclosed and the departments, agencies, or entities to which the disclosure was made.

      * (iii) As used in Rule 6(e)(3)(D), the term "foreign intelligence information" means:

        * (a) information, whether or not it concerns a United States person, that relates to the ability of the United States to protect against—

          * •&nbsp;actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or its agent;

          * •&nbsp;sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power or its agent; or

          * •&nbsp;clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by its agent; or


        * (b) information, whether or not it concerns a United States person, with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to—

          * •&nbsp;the national defense or the security of the United States; or

          * •&nbsp;the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States.


    * (E) The court may authorize disclosure—at a time, in a manner, and subject to any other conditions that it directs—of a grand-jury matter:

      * (i) preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding;

      * (ii) at the request of a defendant who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury;

      * (iii) at the request of the government, when sought by a foreign court or prosecutor for use in an official criminal investigation;

      * (iv) at the request of the government if it shows that the matter may disclose a violation of State, Indian tribal, or foreign criminal law, as long as the disclosure is to an appropriate state, state-subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official for the purpose of enforcing that law; or

      * (v) at the request of the government if it shows that the matter may disclose a violation of military criminal law under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as long as the disclosure is to an appropriate military official for the purpose of enforcing that law.


    * (F) A petition to disclose a grand-jury matter under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) must be filed in the district where the grand jury convened. Unless the hearing is ex parte—as it may be when the government is the petitioner—the petitioner must serve the petition on, and the court must afford a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard to:

      * (i) an attorney for the government;

      * (ii) the parties to the judicial proceeding; and

      * (iii) any other person whom the court may designate.


    * (G) If the petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district, the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court unless the petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper. If the petitioned court decides to transfer, it must send to the transferee court the material sought to be disclosed, if feasible, and a written evaluation of the need for continued grand-jury secrecy. The transferee court must afford those persons identified in Rule 6(e)(3)(F) a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard.


  * (4) _Sealed Indictment._ The magistrate judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pending trial. The clerk must then seal the indictment, and no person may disclose the indictment's existence except as necessary to issue or execute a warrant or summons.

  * (5) _Closed Hearing._ Subject to any right to an open hearing in a contempt proceeding, the court must close any hearing to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.

  * (6) _Sealed Records._ Records, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand-jury proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.

  * (7) _Contempt._ A knowing violation of Rule 6, or of any guidelines jointly issued by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence under Rule 6, may be punished as a contempt of court.


* (f) INDICTMENT AND RETURN. A grand jury may indict only if at least 12 jurors concur. The grand jury—or its foreperson or deputy foreperson—must return the indictment to a magistrate judge in open court. To avoid unnecessary cost or delay, the magistrate judge may take the return by video teleconference from the court where the grand jury sits. If a complaint or information is pending against the defendant and 12 jurors do not concur in the indictment, the foreperson must promptly and in writing report the lack of concurrence to the magistrate judge.

* (g) DISCHARGING THE GRAND JURY. A grand jury must serve until the court discharges it, but it may serve more than 18 months only if the court, having determined that an extension is in the public interest, extends the grand jury's service. An extension may be granted for no more than 6 months, except as otherwise provided by statute.

* (h) EXCUSING A JUROR. At any time, for good cause, the court may excuse a juror either temporarily or permanently, and if permanently, the court may impanel an alternate juror in place of the excused juror.

* (i) "INDIAN TRIBE" DEFINED. "Indian tribe" means an Indian tribe recognized by the Secretary of the Interior on a list published in the Federal Register under 25 U.S.C. §479a–1.

### Rule 7. The Indictment and the Information
* (a) WHEN USED.

  * (1) _Felony._ An offense (other than criminal contempt) must be prosecuted by an indictment if it is punishable:

    * (A) by death; or

    * (B) by imprisonment for more than one year.


  * (2) _Misdemeanor._ An offense punishable by imprisonment for one year or less may be prosecuted in accordance with Rule 58(b)(1).


* (b) WAIVING INDICTMENT. An offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year may be prosecuted by information if the defendant—in open court and after being advised of the nature of the charge and of the defendant's rights—waives prosecution by indictment.

* (c) NATURE AND CONTENTS.

  * (1) _In General._ The indictment or information must be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged and must be signed by an attorney for the government. It need not contain a formal introduction or conclusion. A count may incorporate by reference an allegation made in another count. A count may allege that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown or that the defendant committed it by one or more specified means. For each count, the indictment or information must give the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation, or other provision of law that the defendant is alleged to have violated. For purposes of an indictment referred to in section 3282 of title 18, United States Code, for which the identity of the defendant is unknown, it shall be sufficient for the indictment to describe the defendant as an individual whose name is unknown, but who has a particular DNA profile, as that term is defined in that section 3282.

  * (2) _Citation Error._ Unless the defendant was misled and thereby prejudiced, neither an error in a citation nor a citation's omission is a ground to dismiss the indictment or information or to reverse a conviction.


* (d) SURPLUSAGE. Upon the defendant's motion, the court may strike surplusage from the indictment or information.

* (e) AMENDING AN INFORMATION. Unless an additional or different offense is charged or a substantial right of the defendant is prejudiced, the court may permit an information to be amended at any time before the verdict or finding.

* (f) BILL OF PARTICULARS. The court may direct the government to file a bill of particulars. The defendant may move for a bill of particulars before or within 14 days after arraignment or at a later time if the court permits. The government may amend a bill of particulars subject to such conditions as justice requires.

### Rule 8. Joinder of Offenses or Defendants
* (a) JOINDER OF OFFENSES. The indictment or information may charge a defendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged—whether felonies or misdemeanors or both—are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.

* (b) JOINDER OF DEFENDANTS. The indictment or information may charge 2 or more defendants if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction, or in the same series of acts or transactions, constituting an offense or offenses. The defendants may be charged in one or more counts together or separately. All defendants need not be charged in each count.

### Rule 9. Arrest Warrant or Summons on an Indictment or Information
* (a) ISSUANCE. The court must issue a warrant—or at the government's request, a summons—for each defendant named in an indictment or named in an information if one or more affidavits accompanying the information establish probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant committed it. The court may issue more than one warrant or summons for the same defendant. If a defendant fails to appear in response to a summons, the court may, and upon request of an attorney for the government must, issue a warrant. The court must issue the arrest warrant to an officer authorized to execute it or the summons to a person authorized to serve it.

* (b) FORM.

  * (1) _Warrant._ The warrant must conform to Rule 4(b)(1) except that it must be signed by the clerk and must describe the offense charged in the indictment or information.

  * (2) _Summons._ The summons must be in the same form as a warrant except that it must require the defendant to appear before the court at a stated time and place.


* (c) EXECUTION OR SERVICE; RETURN; INITIAL APPEARANCE.

  * (1) _Execution or Service._

    * (A) The warrant must be executed or the summons served as provided in Rule 4(c)(1), (2), and (3).

    * (B) The officer executing the warrant must proceed in accordance with Rule 5(a)(1).


  * (2) _Return._ A warrant or summons must be returned in accordance with Rule 4(c)(4).

  * (3) _Initial Appearance._ When an arrested or summoned defendant first appears before the court, the judge must proceed under Rule 5.


* (d) WARRANT BY TELEPHONE OR OTHER MEANS. In accordance with Rule 4.1, a magistrate judge may issue an arrest warrant or summons based on information communicated by telephone or other reliable electronic means.
