  * (1) _In General._ The court must impose sentence without unnecessary delay.

  * (2) _Changing Time Limits._ The court may, for good cause, change any time limits prescribed in this rule.


* (c) PRESENTENCE INVESTIGATION.

  * (1) _Required Investigation._

    * (A) _In General_. The probation officer must conduct a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court before it imposes sentence unless:

      * (i) 18 U.S.C. §3593(c) or another statute requires otherwise; or

      * (ii) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. §3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.


    * (B) _Restitution._ If the law permits restitution, the probation officer must conduct an investigation and submit a report that contains sufficient information for the court to order restitution.


  * (2) _Interviewing the Defendant._ The probation officer who interviews a defendant as part of a presentence investigation must, on request, give the defendant's attorney notice and a reasonable opportunity to attend the interview.


* (d) PRESENTENCE REPORT.

  * (1) _Applying the Advisory Sentencing Guidelines_. The presentence report must:

    * (A) identify all applicable guidelines and policy statements of the Sentencing Commission;

    * (B) calculate the defendant's offense level and criminal history category;

    * (C) state the resulting sentencing range and kinds of sentences available;

    * (D) identify any factor relevant to:

      * (i) the appropriate kind of sentence, or

      * (ii) the appropriate sentence within the applicable sentencing range; and


    * (E) identify any basis for departing from the applicable sentencing range.


  * (2) _Additional Information_. The presentence report must also contain the following:

    * (A) the defendant's history and characteristics, including:

      * (i) any prior criminal record;

      * (ii) the defendant's financial condition; and

      * (iii) any circumstances affecting the defendant's behavior that may be helpful in imposing sentence or in correctional treatment;


    * (B) information that assesses any financial, social, psychological, and medical impact on any victim;

    * (C) when appropriate, the nature and extent of nonprison programs and resources available to the defendant;

    * (D) when the law provides for restitution, information sufficient for a restitution order;

    * (E) if the court orders a study under 18 U.S.C. §3552(b), any resulting report and recommendation;

    * (F) a statement of whether the government seeks forfeiture under Rule 32.2 and any other law; and

    * (G) any other information that the court requires, including information relevant to the factors under 18 U.S.C. §3553(a).


  * (3) _Exclusions._ The presentence report must exclude the following:

    * (A) any diagnoses that, if disclosed, might seriously disrupt a rehabilitation program;

    * (B) any sources of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality; and

    * (C) any other information that, if disclosed, might result in physical or other harm to the defendant or others.


* (e) DISCLOSING THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION.

  * (1) _Time to Disclose._ Unless the defendant has consented in writing, the probation officer must not submit a presentence report to the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found guilty.

  * (2) _Minimum Required Notice._ The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's attorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum period.

  * (3) _Sentence Recommendation._ By local rule or by order in a case, the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to anyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence.


* (f) OBJECTING TO THE REPORT.

  * (1) _Time to Object._ Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections, including objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from the report.

  * (2) _Serving Objections._ An objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation officer.

  * (3) _Action on Objections._ After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties to discuss the objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.


* (g) SUBMITTING THE REPORT. At least 7 days before sentencing, the probation officer must submit to the court and to the parties the presentence report and an addendum containing any unresolved objections, the grounds for those objections, and the probation officer's comments on them.

* (h) NOTICE OF POSSIBLE DEPARTURE FROM SENTENCING GUIDELINES. Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.

* (i) SENTENCING.

  * (1) _In General._ At sentencing, the court:

    * (A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any addendum to the report;

    * (B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of—or summarize in camera—any information excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;

    * (C) must allow the parties' attorneys to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence; and

    * (D) may, for good cause, allow a party to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.


  * (2) _Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement._ The court may permit the parties to introduce evidence on the objections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)–(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.

  * (3) _Court Determinations._ At sentencing, the court:

    * (A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;

    * (B) must—for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter—rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing; and

    * (C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made available to the Bureau of Prisons.


  * (4) _Opportunity to Speak._

    * (A) _By a Party._ Before imposing sentence, the court must:

      * (i) provide the defendant's attorney an opportunity to speak on the defendant's behalf;

      * (ii) address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence; and

      * (iii) provide an attorney for the government an opportunity to speak equivalent to that of the defendant's attorney.


    * (B) _By a Victim._ Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of the crime who is present at sentencing and must permit the victim to be reasonably heard.

    * (C) _In Camera Proceedings_. Upon a party's motion and for good cause, the court may hear in camera any statement made under Rule 32(i)(4).


* (j) DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO APPEAL.

  * (1) _Advice of a Right to Appeal._

    * (A) _Appealing a Conviction_. If the defendant pleaded not guilty and was convicted, after sentencing the court must advise the defendant of the right to appeal the conviction.

    * (B) _Appealing a Sentence_. After sentencing—regardless of the defendant's plea—the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.

    * (C) _Appeal Costs_. The court must advise a defendant who is unable to pay appeal costs of the right to ask for permission to appeal in forma pauperis.


  * (2)_Clerk's Filing of Notice._ If the defendant so requests, the clerk must immediately prepare and file a notice of appeal on the defendant's behalf.


* (k) JUDGMENT.

  * (1) _In General._ In the judgment of conviction, the court must set forth the plea, the jury verdict or the court's findings, the adjudication, and the sentence. If the defendant is found not guilty or is otherwise entitled to be discharged, the court must so order. The judge must sign the judgment, and the clerk must enter it.

  * (2) _Criminal Forfeiture._ Forfeiture procedures are governed by Rule 32.2.

### Rule 32.1. Revoking or Modifying Probation or Supervised Release
* (a) INITIAL APPEARANCE.

  * (1) _Person In Custody._ A person held in custody for violating probation or supervised release must be taken without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge.

    * (A) If the person is held in custody in the district where an alleged violation occurred, the initial appearance must be in that district.

    * (B) If the person is held in custody in a district other than where an alleged violation occurred, the initial appearance must be in that district, or in an adjacent district if the appearance can occur more promptly there.


  * (2) _Upon a Summons._ When a person appears in response to a summons for violating probation or supervised release, a magistrate judge must proceed under this rule.

  * (3) _Advice._ The judge must inform the person of the following:

    * (A) the alleged violation of probation or supervised release;

    * (B) the person's right to retain counsel or to request that counsel be appointed if the person cannot obtain counsel; and

    * (C) the person's right, if held in custody, to a preliminary hearing under Rule 32.1(b)(1).


  * (4) _Appearance in the District With Jurisdiction._ If the person is arrested or appears in the district that has jurisdiction to conduct a revocation hearing—either originally or by transfer of jurisdiction—the court must proceed under Rule 32.1(b)–(e).

  * (5) _Appearance in a District Lacking Jurisdiction._ If the person is arrested or appears in a district that does not have jurisdiction to conduct a revocation hearing, the magistrate judge must:

    * (A) if the alleged violation occurred in the district of arrest, conduct a preliminary hearing under Rule 32.1(b) and either:

      * (i) transfer the person to the district that has jurisdiction, if the judge finds probable cause to believe that a violation occurred; or

      * (ii) dismiss the proceedings and so notify the court that has jurisdiction, if the judge finds no probable cause to believe that a violation occurred; or


    * (B) if the alleged violation did not occur in the district of arrest, transfer the person to the district that has jurisdiction if:

      * (i) the government produces certified copies of the judgment, warrant, and warrant application, or produces copies of those certified documents by reliable electronic means; and

      * (ii) the judge finds that the person is the same person named in the warrant.


  * (6) _Release or Detention._ The magistrate judge may release or detain the person under 18 U.S.C. §3143(a)(1) pending further proceedings. The burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the person will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community rests with the person.


* (b) REVOCATION.

  * (1) _Preliminary Hearing._

    * (A) _In General_. If a person is in custody for violating a condition of probation or supervised release, a magistrate judge must promptly conduct a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a violation occurred. The person may waive the hearing.

    * (B) _Requirements_. The hearing must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device. The judge must give the person:

      * (i) notice of the hearing and its purpose, the alleged violation, and the person's right to retain counsel or to request that counsel be appointed if the person cannot obtain counsel;

      * (ii) an opportunity to appear at the hearing and present evidence; and

      * (iii) upon request, an opportunity to question any adverse witness, unless the judge determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.


    * (C) _Referral._ If the judge finds probable cause, the judge must conduct a revocation hearing. If the judge does not find probable cause, the judge must dismiss the proceeding.


  * (2) _Revocation Hearing._ Unless waived by the person, the court must hold the revocation hearing within a reasonable time in the district having jurisdiction. The person is entitled to:

    * (A) written notice of the alleged violation;

    * (B) disclosure of the evidence against the person;

    * (C) an opportunity to appear, present evidence, and question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear;

    * (D) notice of the person's right to retain counsel or to request that counsel be appointed if the person cannot obtain counsel; and

    * (E) an opportunity to make a statement and present any information in mitigation.


* (c) MODIFICATION.

  * (1) _In General._ Before modifying the conditions of probation or supervised release, the court must hold a hearing, at which the person has the right to counsel and an opportunity to make a statement and present any information in mitigation.

  * (2) _Exceptions._ A hearing is not required if:

    * (A) the person waives the hearing; or

    * (B) the relief sought is favorable to the person and does not extend the term of probation or of supervised release; and

    * (C) an attorney for the government has received notice of the relief sought, has had a reasonable opportunity to object, and has not done so.


* (d) DISPOSITION OF THE CASE. The court's disposition of the case is governed by 18 U.S.C. §3563 and §3565 (probation) and §3583 (supervised release).

* (e) PRODUCING A STATEMENT. Rule 26.2(a)–(d) and (f) applies at a hearing under this rule. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.

### Rule 32.2. Criminal Forfeiture
* (a) NOTICE TO THE DEFENDANT. A court must not enter a judgment of forfeiture in a criminal proceeding unless the indictment or information contains notice to the defendant that the government will seek the forfeiture of property as part of any sentence in accordance with the applicable statute. The notice should not be designated as a count of the indictment or information. The indictment or information need not identify the property subject to forfeiture or specify the amount of any forfeiture money judgment that the government seeks.

* (b) ENTERING A PRELIMINARY ORDER OF FORFEITURE.

  * (1) _Forfeiture Phase of the Trial._

    * (A) _Forfeiture Determinations._ As soon as practical after a verdict or finding of guilty, or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is accepted, on any count in an indictment or information regarding which criminal forfeiture is sought, the court must determine what property is subject to forfeiture under the applicable statute. If the government seeks forfeiture of specific property, the court must determine whether the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense. If the government seeks a personal money judgment, the court must determine the amount of money that the defendant will be ordered to pay.

    * (B) _Evidence and Hearing._ The court's determination may be based on evidence already in the record, including any written plea agreement, and on any additional evidence or information submitted by the parties and accepted by the court as relevant and reliable. If the forfeiture is contested, on either party's request the court must conduct a hearing after the verdict or finding of guilty.


  * (2) _Preliminary Order._

    * (A) _Contents of a Specific Order._ If the court finds that property is subject to forfeiture, it must promptly enter a preliminary order of forfeiture setting forth the amount of any money judgment, directing the forfeiture of specific property, and directing the forfeiture of any substitute property if the government has met the statutory criteria. The court must enter the order without regard to any third party's interest in the property. Determining whether a third party has such an interest must be deferred until any third party files a claim in an ancillary proceeding under Rule 32.2(c).

    * (B) _Timing._ Unless doing so is impractical, the court must enter the preliminary order sufficiently in advance of sentencing to allow the parties to suggest revisions or modifications before the order becomes final as to the defendant under Rule 32.2(b)(4).

    * (C) _General Order._ If, before sentencing, the court cannot identify all the specific property subject to forfeiture or calculate the total amount of the money judgment, the court may enter a forfeiture order that:

      * (i) lists any identified property;

      * (ii) describes other property in general terms; and

      * (iii) states that the order will be amended under Rule 32.2(e)(1) when additional specific property is identified or the amount of the money judgment has been calculated.


  * (3) _Seizing Property._ The entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture authorizes the Attorney General (or a designee) to seize the specific property subject to forfeiture; to conduct any discovery the court considers proper in identifying, locating, or disposing of the property; and to commence proceedings that comply with any statutes governing third-party rights. The court may include in the order of forfeiture conditions reasonably necessary to preserve the property's value pending any appeal.

  * (4) _Sentence and Judgment._

    * (A) _When Final._ At sentencing—or at any time before sentencing if the defendant consents—the preliminary forfeiture order becomes final as to the defendant. If the order directs the defendant to forfeit specific property, it remains preliminary as to third parties until the ancillary proceeding is concluded under Rule 32.2(c).

    * (B) _Notice and Inclusion in the Judgment._ The court must include the forfeiture when orally announcing the sentence or must otherwise ensure that the defendant knows of the forfeiture at sentencing. The court must also include the forfeiture order, directly or by reference, in the judgment, but the court's failure to do so may be corrected at any time under Rule 36.

    * (C) _Time to Appeal._ The time for the defendant or the government to file an appeal from the forfeiture order, or from the court's failure to enter an order, begins to run when judgment is entered. If the court later amends or declines to amend a forfeiture order to include additional property under Rule 32.2(e), the defendant or the government may file an appeal regarding that property under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). The time for that appeal runs from the date when the order granting or denying the amendment becomes final.


  * (5) _Jury Determination._

    * (A) _Retaining the Jury._ In any case tried before a jury, if the indictment or information states that the government is seeking forfeiture, the court must determine before the jury begins deliberating whether either party requests that the jury be retained to determine the forfeitability of specific property if it returns a guilty verdict.

    * (B) _Special Verdict Form._ If a party timely requests to have the jury determine forfeiture, the government must submit a proposed Special Verdict Form listing each property subject to forfeiture and asking the jury to determine whether the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense committed by the defendant.


  * (6) _Notice of the Forfeiture Order._

    * (A) _Publishing and Sending Notice._ If the court orders the forfeiture of specific property, the government must publish notice of the order and send notice to any person who reasonably appears to be a potential claimant with standing to contest the forfeiture in the ancillary proceeding.

    * (B) _Content of the Notice._ The notice must describe the forfeited property, state the times under the applicable statute when a petition contesting the forfeiture must be filed, and state the name and contact information for the government attorney to be served with the petition.

    * (C) _Means of Publication; Exceptions to Publication Requirement._ Publication must take place as described in Supplemental Rule G(4)(a)(iii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and may be by any means described in Supplemental Rule G(4)(a)(iv). Publication is unnecessary if any exception in Supplemental Rule G(4)(a)(i) applies.

    * (D) _Means of Sending the Notice._ The notice may be sent in accordance with Supplemental Rules G(4)(b)(iii)–(v) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.


  * (7) _Interlocutory Sale._ At any time before entry of a final forfeiture order, the court, in accordance with Supplemental Rule G(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, may order the interlocutory sale of property alleged to be forfeitable.


* (c) ANCILLARY PROCEEDING; ENTERING A FINAL ORDER OF FORFEITURE.

  * (1) _In General._ If, as prescribed by statute, a third party files a petition asserting an interest in the property to be forfeited, the court must conduct an ancillary proceeding, but no ancillary proceeding is required to the extent that the forfeiture consists of a money judgment.

    * (A) In the ancillary proceeding, the court may, on motion, dismiss the petition for lack of standing, for failure to state a claim, or for any other lawful reason. For purposes of the motion, the facts set forth in the petition are assumed to be true.

    * (B) After disposing of any motion filed under Rule 32.2(c)(1)(A) and before conducting a hearing on the petition, the court may permit the parties to conduct discovery in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the court determines that discovery is necessary or desirable to resolve factual issues. When discovery ends, a party may move for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.


  * (2) _Entering a Final Order._ When the ancillary proceeding ends, the court must enter a final order of forfeiture by amending the preliminary order as necessary to account for any third-party rights. If no third party files a timely petition, the preliminary order becomes the final order of forfeiture if the court finds that the defendant (or any combination of defendants convicted in the case) had an interest in the property that is forfeitable under the applicable statute. The defendant may not object to the entry of the final order on the ground that the property belongs, in whole or in part, to a codefendant or third party; nor may a third party object to the final order on the ground that the third party had an interest in the property.

  * (3) _Multiple Petitions._ If multiple third-party petitions are filed in the same case, an order dismissing or granting one petition is not appealable until rulings are made on all the petitions, unless the court determines that there is no just reason for delay.

  * (4) _Ancillary Proceeding Not Part of Sentencing._ An ancillary proceeding is not part of sentencing.


* (d) STAY PENDING APPEAL. If a defendant appeals from a conviction or an order of forfeiture, the court may stay the order of forfeiture on terms appropriate to ensure that the property remains available pending appellate review. A stay does not delay the ancillary proceeding or the determination of a third party's rights or interests. If the court rules in favor of any third party while an appeal is pending, the court may amend the order of forfeiture but must not transfer any property interest to a third party until the decision on appeal becomes final, unless the defendant consents in writing or on the record.

* (e) SUBSEQUENTLY LOCATED PROPERTY; SUBSTITUTE PROPERTY.

  * (1) _In General._ On the government's motion, the court may at any time enter an order of forfeiture or amend an existing order of forfeiture to include property that:

    * (A) is subject to forfeiture under an existing order of forfeiture but was located and identified after that order was entered; or

    * (B) is substitute property that qualifies for forfeiture under an applicable statute.


  * (2) _Procedure._ If the government shows that the property is subject to forfeiture under Rule 32.2(e)(1), the court must:

    * (A) enter an order forfeiting that property, or amend an existing preliminary or final order to include it; and

    * (B) if a third party files a petition claiming an interest in the property, conduct an ancillary proceeding under Rule 32.2(c).


  * (3) _Jury Trial Limited._ There is no right to a jury trial under Rule 32.2(e).

### Rule 33. New Trial
* (a) DEFENDANT'S MOTION. Upon the defendant's motion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires. If the case was tried without a jury, the court may take additional testimony and enter a new judgment.

* (b) TIME TO FILE.

  * (1) _Newly Discovered Evidence._ Any motion for a new trial grounded on newly discovered evidence must be filed within 3 years after the verdict or finding of guilty. If an appeal is pending, the court may not grant a motion for a new trial until the appellate court remands the case.

  * (2) _Other Grounds._ Any motion for a new trial grounded on any reason other than newly discovered evidence must be filed within 14 days after the verdict or finding of guilty.

### Rule 34. Arresting Judgment
* (a) IN GENERAL. Upon the defendant's motion or on its own, the court must arrest judgment if the court does not have jurisdiction of the charged offense.


* (b) TIME TO FILE. The defendant must move to arrest judgment within 14 days after the court accepts a verdict or finding of guilty, or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.

### Rule 35. Correcting or Reducing a Sentence
* (a) CORRECTING CLEAR ERROR. Within 14 days after sentencing, the court may correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.

* (b) REDUCING A SENTENCE FOR SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE.

  * (1) _In General_. Upon the government's motion made within one year of sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.

  * (2) _Later Motion._ Upon the government's motion made more than one year after sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant's substantial assistance involved:

    * (A) information not known to the defendant until one year or more after sentencing;

    * (B) information provided by the defendant to the government within one year of sentencing, but which did not become useful to the government until more than one year after sentencing; or

    * (C) information the usefulness of which could not reasonably have been anticipated by the defendant until more than one year after sentencing and which was promptly provided to the government after its usefulness was reasonably apparent to the defendant.


  * (3) _Evaluating Substantial Assistance._ In evaluating whether the defendant has provided substantial assistance, the court may consider the defendant's presentence assistance.

  * (4) _Below Statutory Minimum._ When acting under Rule 35(b), the court may reduce the sentence to a level below the minimum sentence established by statute.


* (c) "SENTENCING" DEFINED. As used in this rule, "sentencing" means the oral announcement of the sentence.

### Rule 36. Clerical Error
* After giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.

### Rule 37. Indicative Ruling on a Motion for Relief That Is Barred by a Pending Appeal
* (a) RELIEF PENDING APPEAL. If a timely motion is made for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the court may:

  * (1) defer considering the motion;

  * (2) deny the motion; or

  * (3) state either that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.


* (b) NOTICE TO THE COURT OF APPEALS. The movant must promptly notify the circuit clerk under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 12.1 if the district court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

* (c) REMAND. The district court may decide the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose.

### Rule 38. Staying a Sentence or a Disability
* (a) DEATH SENTENCE. The court must stay a death sentence if the defendant appeals the conviction or sentence.

* (b) IMPRISONMENT.

  * (1) _Stay Granted._ If the defendant is released pending appeal, the court must stay a sentence of imprisonment.

  * (2) _Stay Denied; Place of Confinement._ If the defendant is not released pending appeal, the court may recommend to the Attorney General that the defendant be confined near the place of the trial or appeal for a period reasonably necessary to permit the defendant to assist in preparing the appeal.


* (c) FINE. If the defendant appeals, the district court, or the court of appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8, may stay a sentence to pay a fine or a fine and costs. The court may stay the sentence on any terms considered appropriate and may require the defendant to:

  * (1) deposit all or part of the fine and costs into the district court's registry pending appeal;

  * (2) post a bond to pay the fine and costs; or

  * (3) submit to an examination concerning the defendant's assets and, if appropriate, order the defendant to refrain from dissipating assets.


* (d) PROBATION. If the defendant appeals, the court may stay a sentence of probation. The court must set the terms of any stay.

* (e) RESTITUTION AND NOTICE TO VICTIMS.

  * (1) _In General._ If the defendant appeals, the district court, or the court of appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8, may stay—on any terms considered appropriate—any sentence providing for restitution under 18 U.S.C. §3556 or notice under 18 U.S.C. §3555.

  * (2) _Ensuring Compliance._ The court may issue any order reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with a restitution order or a notice order after disposition of an appeal, including:

    * (A) a restraining order;

    * (B) an injunction;

    * (C) an order requiring the defendant to deposit all or part of any monetary restitution into the district court's registry; or

    * (D) an order requiring the defendant to post a bond.


* (f) FORFEITURE. A stay of a forfeiture order is governed by Rule 32.2(d).

* (g) DISABILITY. If the defendant's conviction or sentence creates a civil or employment disability under federal law, the district court, or the court of appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8, may stay the disability pending appeal on any terms considered appropriate. The court may issue any order reasonably necessary to protect the interest represented by the disability pending appeal, including a restraining order or an injunction.

### Rule 39. [Reserved]
