### TITLE IV. ARRAIGNMENT AND PREPARATION FOR TRIAL

### Rule 10. Arraignment
* (a) IN GENERAL. An arraignment must be conducted in open court and must consist of:

  * (1) ensuring that the defendant has a copy of the indictment or information;

  * (2) reading the indictment or information to the defendant or stating to the defendant the substance of the charge; and then

  * (3) asking the defendant to plead to the indictment or information.


* (b) WAIVING APPEARANCE. A defendant need not be present for the arraignment if:

  * (1) the defendant has been charged by indictment or misdemeanor information;

  * (2) the defendant, in a written waiver signed by both the defendant and defense counsel, has waived appearance and has affirmed that the defendant received a copy of the indictment or information and that the plea is not guilty; and

  * (3) the court accepts the waiver.


* (c) VIDEO TELECONFERENCING. Video teleconferencing may be used to arraign a defendant if the defendant consents.

### Rule 11. Pleas
* (a) ENTERING A PLEA.

  * (1) _In General._ A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty, or (with the court's consent) nolo contendere.

  * (2) _Conditional Plea._ With the consent of the court and the government, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion. A defendant who prevails on appeal may then withdraw the plea.

  * (3) _Nolo Contendere Plea._ Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere, the court must consider the parties' views and the public interest in the effective administration of justice.

  * (4) _Failure to Enter a Plea._ If a defendant refuses to enter a plea or if a defendant organization fails to appear, the court must enter a plea of not guilty.


* (b) CONSIDERING AND ACCEPTING A GUILTY OR NOLO CONTENDERE PLEA.

  * (1) _Advising and Questioning the Defendant_. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the defendant may be placed under oath, and the court must address the defendant personally in open court. During this address, the court must inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands, the following:

    * (A) the government's right, in a prosecution for perjury or false statement, to use against the defendant any statement that the defendant gives under oath;

    * (B) the right to plead not guilty, or having already so pleaded, to persist in that plea;

    * (C) the right to a jury trial;

    * (D) the right to be represented by counsel—and if necessary have the court appoint counsel—at trial and at every other stage of the proceeding;

    * (E) the right at trial to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, to be protected from compelled self-incrimination, to testify and present evidence, and to compel the attendance of witnesses;

    * (F) the defendant's waiver of these trial rights if the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere;

    * (G) the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading;

    * (H) any maximum possible penalty, including imprisonment, fine, and term of supervised release;

    * (I) any mandatory minimum penalty;

    * (J) any applicable forfeiture;

    * (K) the court's authority to order restitution;

    * (L) the court's obligation to impose a special assessment;

    * (M) in determining a sentence, the court's obligation to calculate the applicable sentencing-guideline range and to consider that range, possible departures under the Sentencing Guidelines, and other sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. §3553(a);

    * (N) the terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence; and

    * (O) that, if convicted, a defendant who is not a United States citizen may be removed from the United States, denied citizenship, and denied admission to the United States in the future.


  * (2) _Ensuring That a Plea Is Voluntary._ Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement).

  * (3) _Determining the Factual Basis for a Plea._ Before entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.


* (c) PLEA AGREEMENT PROCEDURE.

  * (1) _In General._ An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. If the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, the plea agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will:

    * (A) not bring, or will move to dismiss, other charges;

    * (B) recommend, or agree not to oppose the defendant's request, that a particular sentence or sentencing range is appropriate or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request does not bind the court); or

    * (C) agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement).


  * (2) _Disclosing a Plea Agreement._ The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea is offered, unless the court for good cause allows the parties to disclose the plea agreement in camera.

  * (3) _Judicial Consideration of a Plea Agreement._

    * (A) To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C), the court may accept the agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the presentence report.

    * (B) To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(B), the court must advise the defendant that the defendant has no right to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the recommendation or request.


  * (4) _Accepting a Plea Agreement._ If the court accepts the plea agreement, it must inform the defendant that to the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C), the agreed disposition will be included in the judgment.

  * (5) _Rejecting a Plea Agreement._ If the court rejects a plea agreement containing provisions of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C), the court must do the following on the record and in open court (or, for good cause, in camera):

    * (A) inform the parties that the court rejects the plea agreement;

    * (B) advise the defendant personally that the court is not required to follow the plea agreement and give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea; and

    * (C) advise the defendant personally that if the plea is not withdrawn, the court may dispose of the case less favorably toward the defendant than the plea agreement contemplated.


* (d) WITHDRAWING A GUILTY OR NOLO CONTENDERE PLEA. A defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere:

  * (1) before the court accepts the plea, for any reason or no reason; or

  * (2) after the court accepts the plea, but before it imposes sentence if:

    * (A) the court rejects a plea agreement under Rule 11(c)(5); or

    * (B) the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.


* (e) FINALITY OF A GUILTY OR NOLO CONTENDERE PLEA. After the court imposes sentence, the defendant may not withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and the plea may be set aside only on direct appeal or collateral attack.

* (f) ADMISSIBILITY OR INADMISSIBILITY OF A PLEA, PLEA DISCUSSIONS, AND RELATED STATEMENTS. The admissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 410.

* (g) RECORDING THE PROCEEDINGS. The proceedings during which the defendant enters a plea must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device. If there is a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea, the record must include the inquiries and advice to the defendant required under Rule 11(b) and (c).

* (h) HARMLESS ERROR. A variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.

### Rule 12. Pleadings and Pretrial Motions
* (a) PLEADINGS. The pleadings in a criminal proceeding are the indictment, the information, and the pleas of not guilty, guilty, and nolo contendere.

* (b) PRETRIAL MOTIONS.

  * (1) _In General._ A party may raise by pretrial motion any defense, objection, or request that the court can determine without a trial on the merits. Rule 47 applies to a pretrial motion.

  * (2) _Motions That May Be Made at Any Time._ A motion that the court lacks jurisdiction may be made at any time while the case is pending.

  * (3) _Motions That Must Be Made Before Trial._ The following defenses, objections, and requests must be raised by pretrial motion if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the motion can be determined without a trial on the merits:

    * (A) a defect in instituting the prosecution, including:

      * (i) improper venue;

      * (ii) preindictment delay;

      * (iii) a violation of the constitutional right to a speedy trial;

      * (iv) selective or vindictive prosecution; and

      * (v) an error in the grand-jury proceeding or preliminary hearing;


    * (B) a defect in the indictment or information, including:

      * (i) joining two or more offenses in the same count (duplicity);

      * (ii) charging the same offense in more than one count (multiplicity);

      * (iii) lack of specificity;

      * (iv) improper joinder; and

      * (v) failure to state an offense;


    * (C) suppression of evidence;

    * (D) severance of charges or defendants under Rule 14; and

    * (E) discovery under Rule 16.


  * (4) _Notice of the Government's Intent to Use Evidence._

    * (A) _At the Government's Discretion._ At the arraignment or as soon afterward as practicable, the government may notify the defendant of its intent to use specified evidence at trial in order to afford the defendant an opportunity to object before trial under Rule 12(b)(3)(C).

    * (B) _At the Defendant's Request._ At the arraignment or as soon afterward as practicable, the defendant may, in order to have an opportunity to move to suppress evidence under Rule 12(b)(3)(C), request notice of the government's intent to use (in its evidence-in-chief at trial) any evidence that the defendant may be entitled to discover under Rule 16.


* (c) DEADLINE FOR A PRETRIAL MOTION; CONSEQUENCES OF NOT MAKING A TIMELY MOTION.

  * (1) _Setting the Deadline._ The court may, at the arraignment or as soon afterward as practicable, set a deadline for the parties to make pretrial motions and may also schedule a motion hearing. If the court does not set one, the deadline is the start of trial.

  * (2) _Extending or Resetting the Deadline._ At any time before trial, the court may extend or reset the deadline for pretrial motions.

  * (3) _Consequences of Not Making a Timely Motion Under Rule 12(b)(3)._ If a party does not meet the deadline for making a Rule 12(b)(3) motion, the motion is untimely. But a court may consider the defense, objection, or request if the party shows good cause.


* (d) RULING ON A MOTION. The court must decide every pretrial motion before trial unless it finds good cause to defer a ruling. The court must not defer ruling on a pretrial motion if the deferral will adversely affect a party's right to appeal. When factual issues are involved in deciding a motion, the court must state its essential findings on the record.

* (e) [RESERVED]

* (f) RECORDING THE PROCEEDINGS. All proceedings at a motion hearing, including any findings of fact and conclusions of law made orally by the court, must be recorded by a court reporter or a suitable recording device.

* (g) DEFENDANT'S CONTINUED CUSTODY OR RELEASE STATUS. If the court grants a motion to dismiss based on a defect in instituting the prosecution, in the indictment, or in the information, it may order the defendant to be released or detained under 18 U.S.C. §3142 for a specified time until a new indictment or information is filed. This rule does not affect any federal statutory period of limitations.

* (h) PRODUCING STATEMENTS AT A SUPPRESSION HEARING. Rule 26.2 applies at a suppression hearing under Rule 12(b)(3)(C). At a suppression hearing, a law enforcement officer is considered a government witness.

### Rule 12.1. Notice of an Alibi Defense
* (a) GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST FOR NOTICE AND DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE.

  * (1) _Government's Request._ An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant notify an attorney for the government of any intended alibi defense. The request must state the time, date, and place of the alleged offense.

  * (2) _Defendant's Response._ Within 14 days after the request, or at some other time the court sets, the defendant must serve written notice on an attorney for the government of any intended alibi defense. The defendant's notice must state:

    * (A) each specific place where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense; and

    * (B) the name, address, and telephone number of each alibi witness on whom the defendant intends to rely.


* (b) DISCLOSING GOVERNMENT WITNESSES.

  * (1) _Disclosure._

    * (A) _In General._ If the defendant serves a Rule 12.1(a)(2) notice, an attorney for the government must disclose in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney:

      * (i) the name of each witness—and the address and telephone number of each witness other than a victim—that the government intends to rely on to establish that the defendant was present at the scene of the alleged offense; and

      * (ii) each government rebuttal witness to the defendant's alibi defense.


    * (B) _Victim's Address and Telephone Number._ If the government intends to rely on a victim's testimony to establish that the defendant was present at the scene of the alleged offense and the defendant establishes a need for the victim's address and telephone number, the court may:

      * (i) order the government to provide the information in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney; or

      * (ii) fashion a reasonable procedure that allows preparation of the defense and also protects the victim's interests.


  * (2) _Time to Disclose._ Unless the court directs otherwise, an attorney for the government must give its Rule 12.1(b)(1) disclosure within 14 days after the defendant serves notice of an intended alibi defense under Rule 12.1(a)(2), but no later than 14 days before trial.


* (c) CONTINUING DUTY TO DISCLOSE.

  * (1) _In General._ Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to the other party the name of each additional witness—and the address and telephone number of each additional witness other than a victim—if:

    * (B) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.1(a) or (b) if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier.


  * (2) _Address and Telephone Number of an Additional Victim Witness._ The address and telephone number of an additional victim witness must not be disclosed except as provided in Rule 12.1 (b)(1)(B).


* (d) EXCEPTIONS. For good cause, the court may grant an exception to any requirement of Rule 12.1(a)–(c).

* (e) FAILURE TO COMPLY. If a party fails to comply with this rule, the court may exclude the testimony of any undisclosed witness regarding the defendant's alibi. This rule does not limit the defendant's right to testify.

* (f) INADMISSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWN INTENTION. Evidence of an intention to rely on an alibi defense, later withdrawn, or of a statement made in connection with that intention, is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the person who gave notice of the intention.

### Rule 12.2. Notice of an Insanity Defense; Mental Examination
* (a) NOTICE OF AN INSANITY DEFENSE. A defendant who intends to assert a defense of insanity at the time of the alleged offense must so notify an attorney for the government in writing within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion, or at any later time the court sets, and file a copy of the notice with the clerk. A defendant who fails to do so cannot rely on an insanity defense. The court may, for good cause, allow the defendant to file the notice late, grant additional trial-preparation time, or make other appropriate orders.

* (b) NOTICE OF EXPERT EVIDENCE OF A MENTAL CONDITION. If a defendant intends to introduce expert evidence relating to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition of the defendant bearing on either (1) the issue of guilt or (2) the issue of punishment in a capital case, the defendant must—within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion or at any later time the court sets—notify an attorney for the government in writing of this intention and file a copy of the notice with the clerk.

  * (2) _Disclosing Results and Reports of Capital Sentencing Examination._ The results and reports of any examination conducted solely under Rule 12.2(c)(1) after notice under Rule 12.2(b)(2) must be sealed and must not be disclosed to any attorney for the government or the defendant unless the defendant is found guilty of one or more capital crimes and the defendant confirms an intent to offer during sentencing proceedings expert evidence on mental condition.

  * (3) _Disclosing Results and Reports of the Defendant's Expert Examination._ After disclosure under Rule 12.2(c)(2) of the results and reports of the government's examination, the defendant must disclose to the government the results and reports of any examination on mental condition conducted by the defendant's expert about which the defendant intends to introduce expert evidence.

  * (4) _Inadmissibility of a Defendant's Statements._ No statement made by a defendant in the course of any examination conducted under this rule (whether conducted with or without the defendant's consent), no testimony by the expert based on the statement, and no other fruits of the statement may be admitted into evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue regarding mental condition on which the defendant:

    * (A) has introduced evidence of incompetency or evidence requiring notice under Rule 12.2(a) or (b)(1), or

    * (B) has introduced expert evidence in a capital sentencing proceeding requiring notice under Rule 12.2(b)(2).

    * (B) submit to an examination when ordered under Rule 12.2(c).


  * (2) _Failure to Disclose._ The court may exclude any expert evidence for which the defendant has failed to comply with the disclosure requirement of Rule 12.2(c)(3).


* (e) INADMISSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWN INTENTION. Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under Rule 12.2(a) or (b), later withdrawn, is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the person who gave notice of the intention.

### Rule 12.3. Notice of a Public-Authority Defense
* (a) NOTICE OF THE DEFENSE AND DISCLOSURE OF WITNESSES.

  * (1) _Notice in General._ If a defendant intends to assert a defense of actual or believed exercise of public authority on behalf of a law enforcement agency or federal intelligence agency at the time of the alleged offense, the defendant must so notify an attorney for the government in writing and must file a copy of the notice with the clerk within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion, or at any later time the court sets. The notice filed with the clerk must be under seal if the notice identifies a federal intelligence agency as the source of public authority.

  * (2) _Contents of Notice._ The notice must contain the following information:

    * (A) the law enforcement agency or federal intelligence agency involved;

    * (D) _Victim's Address and Telephone Number._ If the government intends to rely on a victim's testimony to oppose the defendant's public-authority defense and the defendant establishes a need for the victim's address and telephone number, the court may:

      * (i) order the government to provide the information in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney; or

      * (ii) fashion a reasonable procedure that allows for preparing the defense and also protects the victim's interests.

* (b) CONTINUING DUTY TO DISCLOSE.

  * (1) _In General._ Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to the other party the name of any additional witness—and the address, and telephone number of any additional witness other than a victim—if:

* (e) INADMISSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWN INTENTION. Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under Rule 12.3(a), later withdrawn, is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the person who gave notice of the intention.

### Rule 12.4. Disclosure Statement
* (a) WHO MUST FILE.

  * (1) _Nongovernmental Corporate Party._ Any nongovernmental corporate party to a proceeding in a district court must file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such corporation.

  * (2) _Organizational Victim._ Unless the government shows good cause, it must file a statement identifying any organizational victim of the alleged criminal activity. If the organizational victim is a corporation, the statement must also disclose the information required by Rule 12.4(a)(1) to the extent it can be obtained through due diligence.


* (b) TIME TO FILE; LATER FILING. A party must:

  * (1) file the Rule 12.4(a) statement within 28 days after the defendant's initial appearance; and

  * (2) promptly file a later statement if any required information changes.

### Rule 13. Joint Trial of Separate Cases
* The court may order that separate cases be tried together as though brought in a single indictment or information if all offenses and all defendants could have been joined in a single indictment or information.

### Rule 14. Relief from Prejudicial Joinder
* (a) RELIEF. If the joinder of offenses or defendants in an indictment, an information, or a consolidation for trial appears to prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts, sever the defendants' trials, or provide any other relief that justice requires.

* (b) DEFENDANT'S STATEMENTS. Before ruling on a defendant's motion to sever, the court may order an attorney for the government to deliver to the court for in camera inspection any defendant's statement that the government intends to use as evidence.

### Rule 15. Depositions
* (a) WHEN TAKEN.

  * (1) _In General._ A party may move that a prospective witness be deposed in order to preserve testimony for trial. The court may grant the motion because of exceptional circumstances and in the interest of justice. If the court orders the deposition to be taken, it may also require the deponent to produce at the deposition any designated material that is not privileged, including any book, paper, document, record, recording, or data.

  * (2) _Detained Material Witness._ A witness who is detained under 18 U.S.C. §3144 may request to be deposed by filing a written motion and giving notice to the parties. The court may then order that the deposition be taken and may discharge the witness after the witness has signed under oath the deposition transcript.


* (b) NOTICE.

  * (1) _In General._ A party seeking to take a deposition must give every other party reasonable written notice of the deposition's date and location. The notice must state the name and address of each deponent. If requested by a party receiving the notice, the court may, for good cause, change the deposition's date or location.

  * (2) _To the Custodial Officer._ A party seeking to take the deposition must also notify the officer who has custody of the defendant of the scheduled date and location.


* (c) DEFENDANT'S PRESENCE.

  * (1) _Defendant in Custody._ Except as authorized by Rule 15(c)(3), the officer who has custody of the defendant must produce the defendant at the deposition and keep the defendant in the witness's presence during the examination, unless the defendant:

    * (A) waives in writing the right to be present; or

    * (B) persists in disruptive conduct justifying exclusion after being warned by the court that disruptive conduct will result in the defendant's exclusion.


  * (2) _Defendant Not in Custody._ Except as authorized by Rule 15(c)(3), a defendant who is not in custody has the right upon request to be present at the deposition, subject to any conditions imposed by the court. If the government tenders the defendant's expenses as provided in Rule 15(d) but the defendant still fails to appear, the defendant—absent good cause—waives both the right to appear and any objection to the taking and use of the deposition based on that right.

  * (3) _Taking Depositions Outside the United States Without the Defendant's Presence._ The deposition of a witness who is outside the United States may be taken without the defendant's presence if the court makes case-specific findings of all the following:

    * (A) the witness's testimony could provide substantial proof of a material fact in a felony prosecution;

    * (B) there is a substantial likelihood that the witness's attendance at trial cannot be obtained;

    * (C) the witness's presence for a deposition in the United States cannot be obtained;

    * (D) the defendant cannot be present because:

      * (i) the country where the witness is located will not permit the defendant to attend the deposition;

      * (ii) for an in-custody defendant, secure transportation and continuing custody cannot be assured at the witness's location; or

      * (iii) for an out-of-custody defendant, no reasonable conditions will assure an appearance at the deposition or at trial or sentencing; and


    * (E) the defendant can meaningfully participate in the deposition through reasonable means.


* (d) EXPENSES. If the deposition was requested by the government, the court may—or if the defendant is unable to bear the deposition expenses, the court must—order the government to pay:

  * (1) any reasonable travel and subsistence expenses of the defendant and the defendant's attorney to attend the deposition; and

  * (2) the costs of the deposition transcript.


* (e) MANNER OF TAKING. Unless these rules or a court order provides otherwise, a deposition must be taken and filed in the same manner as a deposition in a civil action, except that:

  * (1) A defendant may not be deposed without that defendant's consent.

  * (2) The scope and manner of the deposition examination and cross-examination must be the same as would be allowed during trial.

  * (3) The government must provide to the defendant or the defendant's attorney, for use at the deposition, any statement of the deponent in the government's possession to which the defendant would be entitled at trial.


* (f) ADMISSIBILITY AND USE AS EVIDENCE. An order authorizing a deposition to be taken under this rule does not determine its admissibility. A party may use all or part of a deposition as provided by the Federal Rules of Evidence.

* (g) OBJECTIONS. A party objecting to deposition testimony or evidence must state the grounds for the objection during the deposition.

* (h) DEPOSITIONS BY AGREEMENT PERMITTED. The parties may by agreement take and use a deposition with the court's consent.

### Rule 16. Discovery and Inspection
* (a) GOVERNMENT'S DISCLOSURE.

  * (1) _Information Subject to Disclosure._

    * (A) _Defendant's Oral Statement_.

    * (B) _Defendant's Written or Recorded Statement_. Upon a defendant's request, the government must disclose to the defendant, and make available for inspection, copying, or photographing, all of the following:

      * (i) any relevant written or recorded statement by the defendant if:

        * •&nbsp;statement is within the government's possession, custody, or control; and

        * •&nbsp;the attorney for the government knows—or through due diligence could know—that the statement exists;


      * (ii) the portion of any written record containing the substance of any relevant oral statement made before or after arrest if the defendant made the statement in response to interrogation by a person the defendant knew was a government agent; and

    * (C) _Organizational Defendant_. Upon a defendant's request, if the defendant is an organization, the government must disclose to the defendant any statement described in Rule 16(a)(1)(A) and (B) if the government contends that the person making the statement:

      * (i) was legally able to bind the defendant regarding the subject of the statement because of that person's position as the defendant's director, officer, employee, or agent; or

      * (ii) was personally involved in the alleged conduct constituting the offense and was legally able to bind the defendant regarding that conduct because of that person's position as the defendant's director, officer, employee, or agent.


    * (D) _Defendant's Prior Record_. Upon a defendant's request, the government must furnish the defendant with a copy of the defendant's prior criminal record that is within the government's possession, custody, or control if the attorney for the government knows—or through due diligence could know—that the record exists.

    * (E) _Documents and Objects_. Upon a defendant's request, the government must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is within the government's possession, custody, or control and:

    * (A) reports, memoranda, or other documents made by the defendant, or the defendant's attorney or agent, during the case's investigation or defense; or

      * (i) the defendant;

      * (ii) a government or defense witness; or

      * (iii) a prospective government or defense witness.


* (c) CONTINUING DUTY TO DISCLOSE. A party who discovers additional evidence or material before or during trial must promptly disclose its existence to the other party or the court if:

  * (1) the evidence or material is subject to discovery or inspection under this rule; and

  * (2) the other party previously requested, or the court ordered, its production.


* (d) REGULATING DISCOVERY.

  * (1) _Protective and Modifying Orders_. At any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief. The court may permit a party to show good cause by a written statement that the court will inspect ex parte. If relief is granted, the court must preserve the entire text of the party's statement under seal.

  * (2) _Failure to Comply_. If a party fails to comply with this rule, the court may:

    * (A) order that party to permit the discovery or inspection; specify its time, place, and manner; and prescribe other just terms and conditions;

### Rule 16.1. Pretrial Discovery Conference; Request for Court Action
* (a) DISCOVERY CONFERENCE. No later than 14 days after the arraignment, the attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney must confer and try to agree on a timetable and procedures for pretrial disclosure under Rule 16.

* (b) REQUEST FOR COURT ACTION. After the discovery conference, one or both parties may ask the court to determine or modify the time, place, manner, or other aspects of disclosure to facilitate preparation for trial.

### Rule 17. Subpoena
* (a) CONTENT. A subpoena must state the court's name and the title of the proceeding, include the seal of the court, and command the witness to attend and testify at the time and place the subpoena specifies. The clerk must issue a blank subpoena—signed and sealed—to the party requesting it, and that party must fill in the blanks before the subpoena is served.

* (b) DEFENDANT UNABLE TO PAY. Upon a defendant's ex parte application, the court must order that a subpoena be issued for a named witness if the defendant shows an inability to pay the witness's fees and the necessity of the witness's presence for an adequate defense. If the court orders a subpoena to be issued, the process costs and witness fees will be paid in the same manner as those paid for witnesses the government subpoenas.

* (c) PRODUCING DOCUMENTS AND OBJECTS.

  * (1) _In General._ A subpoena may order the witness to produce any books, papers, documents, data, or other objects the subpoena designates. The court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be offered in evidence. When the items arrive, the court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them.

  * (2) _Quashing or Modifying the Subpoena._ On motion made promptly, the court may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.

  * (3) _Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About a Victim._ After a complaint, indictment, or information is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court order. Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.


* (d) SERVICE. A marshal, a deputy marshal, or any nonparty who is at least 18 years old may serve a subpoena. The server must deliver a copy of the subpoena to the witness and must tender to the witness one day's witness-attendance fee and the legal mileage allowance. The server need not tender the attendance fee or mileage allowance when the United States, a federal officer, or a federal agency has requested the subpoena.

* (e) PLACE OF SERVICE.

  * (1) _In the United States._ A subpoena requiring a witness to attend a hearing or trial may be served at any place within the United States.

  * (2) _In a Foreign Country._ If the witness is in a foreign country, 28 U.S.C. §1783 governs the subpoena's service.


* (f) ISSUING A DEPOSITION SUBPOENA.

  * (1) _Issuance._ A court order to take a deposition authorizes the clerk in the district where the deposition is to be taken to issue a subpoena for any witness named or described in the order.

  * (2) _Place._ After considering the convenience of the witness and the parties, the court may order—and the subpoena may require—the witness to appear anywhere the court designates.


* (g) CONTEMPT. The court (other than a magistrate judge) may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a subpoena issued by a federal court in that district. A magistrate judge may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a subpoena issued by that magistrate judge as provided in 28 U.S.C. §636(e).

* (h) INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO A SUBPOENA. No party may subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness under this rule. Rule 26.2 governs the production of the statement.

### Rule 17.1. Pretrial Conference
* On its own, or on a party's motion, the court may hold one or more pretrial conferences to promote a fair and expeditious trial. When a conference ends, the court must prepare and file a memorandum of any matters agreed to during the conference. The government may not use any statement made during the conference by the defendant or the defendant's attorney unless it is in writing and is signed by the defendant and the defendant's attorney.
