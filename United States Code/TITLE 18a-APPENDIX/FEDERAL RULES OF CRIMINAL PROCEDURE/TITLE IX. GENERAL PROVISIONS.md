### TITLE IX. GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Rule 43. Defendant's Presence
* (a) WHEN REQUIRED. Unless this rule, Rule 5, or Rule 10 provides otherwise, the defendant must be present at:

  * (1) the initial appearance, the initial arraignment, and the plea;

  * (2) every trial stage, including jury impanelment and the return of the verdict; and

  * (3) sentencing.


* (b) WHEN NOT REQUIRED. A defendant need not be present under any of the following circumstances:

  * (1) _Organizational Defendant._ The defendant is an organization represented by counsel who is present.

  * (2) _Misdemeanor Offense._ The offense is punishable by fine or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, and with the defendant's written consent, the court permits arraignment, plea, trial, and sentencing to occur by video teleconferencing or in the defendant's absence.

  * (3) _Conference or Hearing on a Legal Question._ The proceeding involves only a conference or hearing on a question of law.

  * (4) _Sentence Correction._ The proceeding involves the correction or reduction of sentence under Rule 35 or 18 U.S.C. §3582(c).


* (c) WAIVING CONTINUED PRESENCE.

  * (1) _In General._ A defendant who was initially present at trial, or who had pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, waives the right to be present under the following circumstances:

    * (A) when the defendant is voluntarily absent after the trial has begun, regardless of whether the court informed the defendant of an obligation to remain during trial;

    * (B) in a noncapital case, when the defendant is voluntarily absent during sentencing; or

    * (C) when the court warns the defendant that it will remove the defendant from the courtroom for disruptive behavior, but the defendant persists in conduct that justifies removal from the courtroom.


  * (2) _Waiver's Effect._ If the defendant waives the right to be present, the trial may proceed to completion, including the verdict's return and sentencing, during the defendant's absence.

### Rule 44. Right to and Appointment of Counsel
* (a) RIGHT TO APPOINTED COUNSEL. A defendant who is unable to obtain counsel is entitled to have counsel appointed to represent the defendant at every stage of the proceeding from initial appearance through appeal, unless the defendant waives this right.

* (b) APPOINTMENT PROCEDURE. Federal law and local court rules govern the procedure for implementing the right to counsel.

* (c) INQUIRY INTO JOINT REPRESENTATION.

  * (1) _Joint Representation._ Joint representation occurs when:

    * (A) two or more defendants have been charged jointly under Rule 8(b) or have been joined for trial under Rule 13; and

    * (B) the defendants are represented by the same counsel, or counsel who are associated in law practice.


  * (2) _Court's Responsibilities in Cases of Joint Representation._ The court must promptly inquire about the propriety of joint representation and must personally advise each defendant of the right to the effective assistance of counsel, including separate representation. Unless there is good cause to believe that no conflict of interest is likely to arise, the court must take appropriate measures to protect each defendant's right to counsel.

### Rule 45. Computing and Extending Time
* (a) COMPUTING TIME. The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time.

  * (1) _Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit._ When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time:

    * (A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;

    * (B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and

    * (C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (2) _Period Stated in Hours._ When the period is stated in hours:

    * (A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;

    * (B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and

    * (C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (3) _Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office._ Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:

    * (A) on the last day for filing under Rule 45(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or

    * (B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 45(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (4) _"Last Day" Defined._ Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:

    * (A) for electronic filing, at midnight in the court's time zone; and

    * (B) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is scheduled to close.


  * (5) _"Next Day" Defined._ The "next day" is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.

  * (6) _"Legal Holiday" Defined._ "Legal holiday" means:

    * (A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;

    * (B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress; and

    * (C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a holiday by the state where the district court is located.


* (b) EXTENDING TIME.

  * (1) _In General._ When an act must or may be done within a specified period, the court on its own may extend the time, or for good cause may do so on a party's motion made:

    * (A) before the originally prescribed or previously extended time expires; or

    * (B) after the time expires if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.


  * (2) _Exception._ The court may not extend the time to take any action under Rule 35, except as stated in that rule.


* (c) ADDITIONAL TIME AFTER CERTAIN KINDS OF SERVICE. Whenever a party must or may act within a specified time after being served and service is made under Rule 49(a)(4)(C), (D), and (E), 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under subdivision (a).

### Rule 46. Release from Custody; Supervising Detention
* (a) BEFORE TRIAL. The provisions of 18 U.S.C. §§3142 and 3144 govern pretrial release.

* (b) DURING TRIAL. A person released before trial continues on release during trial under the same terms and conditions. But the court may order different terms and conditions or terminate the release if necessary to ensure that the person will be present during trial or that the person's conduct will not obstruct the orderly and expeditious progress of the trial.

* (c) PENDING SENTENCING OR APPEAL. The provisions of 18 U.S.C. §3143 govern release pending sentencing or appeal. The burden of establishing that the defendant will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community rests with the defendant.

* (d) PENDING HEARING ON A VIOLATION OF PROBATION OR SUPERVISED RELEASE. Rule 32.1(a)(6) governs release pending a hearing on a violation of probation or supervised release.

* (e) SURETY. The court must not approve a bond unless any surety appears to be qualified. Every surety, except a legally approved corporate surety, must demonstrate by affidavit that its assets are adequate. The court may require the affidavit to describe the following:

  * (1) the property that the surety proposes to use as security;

  * (2) any encumbrance on that property;

  * (3) the number and amount of any other undischarged bonds and bail undertakings the surety has issued; and

  * (4) any other liability of the surety.


* (f) BAIL FORFEITURE.

  * (1) _Declaration._ The court must declare the bail forfeited if a condition of the bond is breached.

  * (2) _Setting Aside._ The court may set aside in whole or in part a bail forfeiture upon any condition the court may impose if:

    * (A) the surety later surrenders into custody the person released on the surety's appearance bond; or

    * (B) it appears that justice does not require bail forfeiture.


  * (3) _Enforcement._

    * (A) _Default Judgment and Execution_. If it does not set aside a bail forfeiture, the court must, upon the government's motion, enter a default judgment.

    * (B) _Jurisdiction and Service_. By entering into a bond, each surety submits to the district court's jurisdiction and irrevocably appoints the district clerk as its agent to receive service of any filings affecting its liability.

    * (C) _Motion to Enforce_. The court may, upon the government's motion, enforce the surety's liability without an independent action. The government must serve any motion, and notice as the court prescribes, on the district clerk. If so served, the clerk must promptly mail a copy to the surety at its last known address.


  * (4) _Remission._ After entering a judgment under Rule 46(f)(3), the court may remit in whole or in part the judgment under the same conditions specified in Rule 46(f)(2).


* (g) EXONERATION. The court must exonerate the surety and release any bail when a bond condition has been satisfied or when the court has set aside or remitted the forfeiture. The court must exonerate a surety who deposits cash in the amount of the bond or timely surrenders the defendant into custody.

* (h) SUPERVISING DETENTION PENDING TRIAL.

  * (1) _In General._ To eliminate unnecessary detention, the court must supervise the detention within the district of any defendants awaiting trial and of any persons held as material witnesses.

  * (2) _Reports._ An attorney for the government must report biweekly to the court, listing each material witness held in custody for more than 10 days pending indictment, arraignment, or trial. For each material witness listed in the report, an attorney for the government must state why the witness should not be released with or without a deposition being taken under Rule 15(a).


* (i) FORFEITURE OF PROPERTY. The court may dispose of a charged offense by ordering the forfeiture of 18 U.S.C. §3142(c)(1)(B)(xi) property under 18 U.S.C. §3146(d), if a fine in the amount of the property's value would be an appropriate sentence for the charged offense.

* (j) PRODUCING A STATEMENT.

  * (1) _In General._ Rule 26.2(a)–(d) and (f) applies at a detention hearing under 18 U.S.C. §3142, unless the court for good cause rules otherwise.

  * (2) _Sanctions for Not Producing a Statement._ If a party disobeys a Rule 26.2 order to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony at the detention hearing.

### Rule 47. Motions and Supporting Affidavits
* (a) IN GENERAL. A party applying to the court for an order must do so by motion.

* (b) FORM AND CONTENT OF A MOTION. A motion—except when made during a trial or hearing—must be in writing, unless the court permits the party to make the motion by other means. A motion must state the grounds on which it is based and the relief or order sought. A motion may be supported by affidavit.

* (c) TIMING OF A MOTION. A party must serve a written motion—other than one that the court may hear ex parte—and any hearing notice at least 7 days before the hearing date, unless a rule or court order sets a different period. For good cause, the court may set a different period upon ex parte application.

* (d) AFFIDAVIT SUPPORTING A MOTION. The moving party must serve any supporting affidavit with the motion. A responding party must serve any opposing affidavit at least one day before the hearing, unless the court permits later service.

### Rule 48. Dismissal
* (a) BY THE GOVERNMENT. The government may, with leave of court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint. The government may not dismiss the prosecution during trial without the defendant's consent.

* (b) BY THE COURT. The court may dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint if unnecessary delay occurs in:

  * (1) presenting a charge to a grand jury;

  * (2) filing an information against a defendant; or

  * (3) bringing a defendant to trial.

### Rule 49. Serving and Filing Papers
* (a) SERVICE ON A PARTY.

  * (1) _What is Required._ Each of the following must be served on every party: any written motion (other than one to be heard ex parte), written notice, designation of the record on appeal, or similar paper.

  * (2) _Serving a Party's Attorney._ Unless the court orders otherwise, when these rules or a court order requires or permits service on a party represented by an attorney, service must be made on the attorney instead of the party.

  * (3) _Service by Electronic Means._

    * (A) _Using the Court's Electronic-Filing System._ A party represented by an attorney may serve a paper on a registered user by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system. A party not represented by an attorney may do so only if allowed by court order or local rule. Service is complete upon filing, but is not effective if the serving party learns that it did not reach the person to be served.

    * (B) _Using Other Electronic Means._ A paper may be served by any other electronic means that the person consented to in writing. Service is complete upon transmission, but is not effective if the serving party learns that it did not reach the person to be served.


  * (4) _Service by Nonelectronic Means._ A paper may be served by:

    * (A) handing it to the person;

    * (B) leaving it:

      * (i) at the person's office with a clerk or other person in charge or, if no one is in charge, in a conspicuous place in the office; or

      * (ii) if the person has no office or the office is closed, at the person's dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there;


    * (C) mailing it to the person's last known address—in which event service is complete upon mailing;

    * (D) leaving it with the court clerk if the person has no known address; or

    * (E) delivering it by any other means that the person consented to in writing—in which event service is complete when the person making service delivers it to the agency designated to make delivery.


* (b) FILING.

  * (1) _When Required; Certificate of Service._ Any paper that is required to be served must be filed no later than a reasonable time after service. No certificate of service is required when a paper is served by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system. When a paper is served by other means, a certificate of service must be filed with it or within a reasonable time after service or filing.

  * (2) _Means of Filing._

    * (A) _Electronically._ A paper is filed electronically by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system. A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with the person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature. A paper filed electronically is written or in writing under these rules.

    * (B) _Nonelectronically._ A paper not filed electronically is filed by delivering it:

      * (i) to the clerk; or

      * (ii) to a judge who agrees to accept it for filing, and who must then note the filing date on the paper and promptly send it to the clerk.


  * (3) _Means Used by Represented and Unrepresented Parties._

    * (A) _Represented Party._ A party represented by an attorney must file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is allowed by the court for good cause or is allowed or required by local rule.

    * (B) _Unrepresented Party._ A party not represented by an attorney must file nonelectronically, unless allowed to file electronically by court order or local rule.


  * (4) _Signature._ Every written motion and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name—or by a person filing a paper if the person is not represented by an attorney. The paper must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney's or person's attention.

  * (5) _Acceptance by the Clerk._ The clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice.


* (c) SERVICE AND FILING BY NONPARTIES. A nonparty may serve and file a paper only if doing so is required or permitted by law. A nonparty must serve every party as required by Rule 49(a), but may use the court's electronic-filing system only if allowed by court order or local rule.

* (d) NOTICE OF A COURT ORDER. When the court issues an order on any post-arraignment motion, the clerk must serve notice of the entry on each party as required by Rule 49(a). A party also may serve notice of the entry by the same means. Except as Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b) provides otherwise, the clerk's failure to give notice does not affect the time to appeal, or relieve—or authorize the court to relieve—a party's failure to appeal within the allowed time.

### Rule 49.1. Privacy Protection For Filings Made with the Court
* (a) REDACTED FILINGS. Unless the court orders otherwise, in an electronic or paper filing with the court that contains an individual's social-security number, taxpayer-identification number, or birth date, the name of an individual known to be a minor, a financial-account number, or the home address of an individual, a party or nonparty making the filing may include only:

  * (1) the last four digits of the social-security number and taxpayer-identification number;

  * (2) the year of the individual's birth;

  * (3) the minor's initials;

  * (4) the last four digits of the financial-account number; and

  * (5) the city and state of the home address.


* (b) EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REDACTION REQUIREMENT. The redaction requirement does not apply to the following:

  * (1) a financial-account number or real property address that identifies the property allegedly subject to forfeiture in a forfeiture proceeding;

  * (2) the record of an administrative or agency proceeding;

  * (3) the official record of a state-court proceeding;

  * (4) the record of a court or tribunal, if that record was not subject to the redaction requirement when originally filed;

  * (5) a filing covered by Rule 49.1(d);

  * (6) a pro se filing in an action brought under 28 U.S.C. §§2241, 2254, or 2255;

  * (7) a court filing that is related to a criminal matter or investigation and that is prepared before the filing of a criminal charge or is not filed as part of any docketed criminal case;

  * (8) an arrest or search warrant; and

  * (9) a charging document and an affidavit filed in support of any charging document.


* (c) IMMIGRATION CASES. A filing in an action brought under 28 U.S.C. §2241 that relates to the petitioner's immigration rights is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2.

* (d) FILINGS MADE UNDER SEAL. The court may order that a filing be made under seal without redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing to file a redacted version for the public record.

* (e) PROTECTIVE ORDERS. For good cause, the court may by order in a case:

  * (1) require redaction of additional information; or

  * (2) limit or prohibit a nonparty's remote electronic access to a document filed with the court.


* (f) OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL UNREDACTED FILING UNDER SEAL. A person making a redacted filing may also file an unredacted copy under seal. The court must retain the unredacted copy as part of the record.

* (g) OPTION FOR FILING A REFERENCE LIST. A filing that contains redacted information may be filed together with a reference list that identifies each item of redacted information and specifies an appropriate identifier that uniquely corresponds to each item listed. The list must be filed under seal and may be amended as of right. Any reference in the case to a listed identifier will be construed to refer to the corresponding item of information.

* (h) WAIVER OF PROTECTION OF IDENTIFIERS. A person waives the protection of Rule 49.1(a) as to the person's own information by filing it without redaction and not under seal.

### Rule 50. Prompt Disposition
* Scheduling preference must be given to criminal proceedings as far as practicable.

### Rule 51. Preserving Claimed Error
* (a) EXCEPTIONS UNNECESSARY. Exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary.

* (b) PRESERVING A CLAIM OF ERROR. A party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court—when the court ruling or order is made or sought—of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party's objection to the court's action and the grounds for that objection. If a party does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence of an objection does not later prejudice that party. A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 103.

### Rule 52. Harmless and Plain Error
* (a) HARMLESS ERROR. Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.

* (b) PLAIN ERROR. A plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court's attention.

### Rule 53. Courtroom Photographing and Broadcasting Prohibited
* Except as otherwise provided by a statute or these rules, the court must not permit the taking of photographs in the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom.

### Rule 54. [Transferred]

### Rule 55. Records
* The clerk of the district court must keep records of criminal proceedings in the form prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The clerk must enter in the records every court order or judgment and the date of entry.

### Rule 56. When Court Is Open
* (a) IN GENERAL. A district court is considered always open for any filing, and for issuing and returning process, making a motion, or entering an order.

* (b) OFFICE HOURS. The clerk's office—with the clerk or a deputy in attendance—must be open during business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.

* (c) SPECIAL HOURS. A court may provide by local rule or order that its clerk's office will be open for specified hours on Saturdays or legal holidays other than those set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

### Rule 57. District Court Rules
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Adopting Local Rules._ Each district court acting by a majority of its district judges may, after giving appropriate public notice and an opportunity to comment, make and amend rules governing its practice. A local rule must be consistent with—but not duplicative of—federal statutes and rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. §2072 and must conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States.

  * (2) _Limiting Enforcement._ A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose rights because of an unintentional failure to comply with the requirement.


* (b) PROCEDURE WHEN THERE IS NO CONTROLLING LAW. A judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, these rules, and the local rules of the district. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or the local district rules unless the alleged violator was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the noncompliance.

* (c) EFFECTIVE DATE AND NOTICE. A local rule adopted under this rule takes effect on the date specified by the district court and remains in effect unless amended by the district court or abrogated by the judicial council of the circuit in which the district is located. Copies of local rules and their amendments, when promulgated, must be furnished to the judicial council and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and must be made available to the public.

### Rule 58. Petty Offenses and Other Misdemeanors
* (a) SCOPE.

  * (1) _In General._ These rules apply in petty offense and other misdemeanor cases and on appeal to a district judge in a case tried by a magistrate judge, unless this rule provides otherwise.

  * (2) _Petty Offense Case Without Imprisonment._ In a case involving a petty offense for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed, the court may follow any provision of these rules that is not inconsistent with this rule and that the court considers appropriate.

  * (3) _Definition._ As used in this rule, the term "petty offense for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed" means a petty offense for which the court determines that, in the event of conviction, no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed.


* (b) PRETRIAL PROCEDURE.

  * (1) _Charging Document._ The trial of a misdemeanor may proceed on an indictment, information, or complaint. The trial of a petty offense may also proceed on a citation or violation notice.

  * (2) _Initial Appearance._ At the defendant's initial appearance on a petty offense or other misdemeanor charge, the magistrate judge must inform the defendant of the following:

    * (A) the charge, and the minimum and maximum penalties, including imprisonment, fines, any special assessment under 18 U.S.C. §3013, and restitution under 18 U.S.C. §3556;

    * (B) the right to retain counsel;

    * (C) the right to request the appointment of counsel if the defendant is unable to retain counsel—unless the charge is a petty offense for which the appointment of counsel is not required;

    * (D) the defendant's right not to make a statement, and that any statement made may be used against the defendant;

    * (E) the right to trial, judgment, and sentencing before a district judge—unless:

      * (i) the charge is a petty offense; or

      * (ii) the defendant consents to trial, judgment, and sentencing before a magistrate judge;


    * (F) the right to a jury trial before either a magistrate judge or a district judge—unless the charge is a petty offense;

    * (G) any right to a preliminary hearing under Rule 5.1, and the general circumstances, if any, under which the defendant may secure pretrial release; and

    * (H) that a defendant who is not a United States citizen may request that an attorney for the government or a federal law enforcement official notify a consular officer from the defendant's country of nationality that the defendant has been arrested—but that even without the defendant's request, a treaty or other international agreement may require consular notification.


  * (3) _Arraignment._

    * (A) _Plea Before a Magistrate Judge_. A magistrate judge may take the defendant's plea in a petty offense case. In every other misdemeanor case, a magistrate judge may take the plea only if the defendant consents either in writing or on the record to be tried before a magistrate judge and specifically waives trial before a district judge. The defendant may plead not guilty, guilty, or (with the consent of the magistrate judge) nolo contendere.

    * (B) _Failure to Consent_. Except in a petty offense case, the magistrate judge must order a defendant who does not consent to trial before a magistrate judge to appear before a district judge for further proceedings.


* (c) ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES IN CERTAIN PETTY OFFENSE CASES. The following procedures also apply in a case involving a petty offense for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed:

  * (1) _Guilty or Nolo Contendere Plea._ The court must not accept a guilty or nolo contendere plea unless satisfied that the defendant understands the nature of the charge and the maximum possible penalty.

  * (2) _Waiving Venue._

    * (A) _Conditions of Waiving Venue_. If a defendant is arrested, held, or present in a district different from the one where the indictment, information, complaint, citation, or violation notice is pending, the defendant may state in writing a desire to plead guilty or nolo contendere; to waive venue and trial in the district where the proceeding is pending; and to consent to the court's disposing of the case in the district where the defendant was arrested, is held, or is present.

    * (B) _Effect of Waiving Venue_. Unless the defendant later pleads not guilty, the prosecution will proceed in the district where the defendant was arrested, is held, or is present. The district clerk must notify the clerk in the original district of the defendant's waiver of venue. The defendant's statement of a desire to plead guilty or nolo contendere is not admissible against the defendant.


  * (3) _Sentencing._ The court must give the defendant an opportunity to be heard in mitigation and then proceed immediately to sentencing. The court may, however, postpone sentencing to allow the probation service to investigate or to permit either party to submit additional information.

  * (4) _Notice of a Right to Appeal._ After imposing sentence in a case tried on a not-guilty plea, the court must advise the defendant of a right to appeal the conviction and of any right to appeal the sentence. If the defendant was convicted on a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.


* (d) PAYING A FIXED SUM IN LIEU OF APPEARANCE.

  * (1) _In General._ If the court has a local rule governing forfeiture of collateral, the court may accept a fixed-sum payment in lieu of the defendant's appearance and end the case, but the fixed sum may not exceed the maximum fine allowed by law.

  * (2) _Notice to Appear._ If the defendant fails to pay a fixed sum, request a hearing, or appear in response to a citation or violation notice, the district clerk or a magistrate judge may issue a notice for the defendant to appear before the court on a date certain. The notice may give the defendant an additional opportunity to pay a fixed sum in lieu of appearance. The district clerk must serve the notice on the defendant by mailing a copy to the defendant's last known address.

  * (3) _Summons or Warrant._ Upon an indictment, or upon a showing by one of the other charging documents specified in Rule 58(b)(1) of probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, the court may issue an arrest warrant or, if no warrant is requested by an attorney for the government, a summons. The showing of probable cause must be made under oath or under penalty of perjury, but the affiant need not appear before the court. If the defendant fails to appear before the court in response to a summons, the court may summarily issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest.


* (e) RECORDING THE PROCEEDINGS. The court must record any proceedings under this rule by using a court reporter or a suitable recording device.

* (f) NEW TRIAL. Rule 33 applies to a motion for a new trial.

* (g) APPEAL.

  * (1) _From a District Judge's Order or Judgment._ The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure govern an appeal from a district judge's order or a judgment of conviction or sentence.

  * (2) _From a Magistrate Judge's Order or Judgment._

    * (A) _Interlocutory Appeal._ Either party may appeal an order of a magistrate judge to a district judge within 14 days of its entry if a district judge's order could similarly be appealed. The party appealing must file a notice with the clerk specifying the order being appealed and must serve a copy on the adverse party.

    * (B) _Appeal from a Conviction or Sentence._ A defendant may appeal a magistrate judge's judgment of conviction or sentence to a district judge within 14 days of its entry. To appeal, the defendant must file a notice with the clerk specifying the judgment being appealed and must serve a copy on an attorney for the government.

    * (C) _Record_. The record consists of the original papers and exhibits in the case; any transcript, tape, or other recording of the proceedings; and a certified copy of the docket entries. For purposes of the appeal, a copy of the record of the proceedings must be made available to a defendant who establishes by affidavit an inability to pay or give security for the record. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts must pay for those copies.

    * (D) _Scope of Appeal_. The defendant is not entitled to a trial de novo by a district judge. The scope of the appeal is the same as in an appeal to the court of appeals from a judgment entered by a district judge.


  * (3) _Stay of Execution and Release Pending Appeal._ Rule 38 applies to a stay of a judgment of conviction or sentence. The court may release the defendant pending appeal under the law relating to release pending appeal from a district court to a court of appeals.

### Rule 59. Matters Before a Magistrate Judge
* (a) NONDISPOSITIVE MATTERS. A district judge may refer to a magistrate judge for determination any matter that does not dispose of a charge or defense. The magistrate judge must promptly conduct the required proceedings and, when appropriate, enter on the record an oral or written order stating the determination. A party may serve and file objections to the order within 14 days after being served with a copy of a written order or after the oral order is stated on the record, or at some other time the court sets. The district judge must consider timely objections and modify or set aside any part of the order that is contrary to law or clearly erroneous. Failure to object in accordance with this rule waives a party's right to review.

* (b) DISPOSITIVE MATTERS.

  * (1) _Referral to Magistrate Judge._ A district judge may refer to a magistrate judge for recommendation a defendant's motion to dismiss or quash an indictment or information, a motion to suppress evidence, or any matter that may dispose of a charge or defense. The magistrate judge must promptly conduct the required proceedings. A record must be made of any evidentiary proceeding and of any other proceeding if the magistrate judge considers it necessary. The magistrate judge must enter on the record a recommendation for disposing of the matter, including any proposed findings of fact. The clerk must immediately serve copies on all parties.

  * (2) _Objections to Findings and Recommendations._ Within 14 days after being served with a copy of the recommended disposition, or at some other time the court sets, a party may serve and file specific written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations. Unless the district judge directs otherwise, the objecting party must promptly arrange for transcribing the record, or whatever portions of it the parties agree to or the magistrate judge considers sufficient. Failure to object in accordance with this rule waives a party's right to review.

  * (3) _De Novo Review of Recommendations._ The district judge must consider de novo any objection to the magistrate judge's recommendation. The district judge may accept, reject, or modify the recommendation, receive further evidence, or resubmit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.

### Rule 60. Victim's Rights
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Notice of a Proceeding._ The government must use its best efforts to give the victim reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding involving the crime.

  * (2) _Attending the Proceeding._ The court must not exclude a victim from a public court proceeding involving the crime, unless the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the victim's testimony would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding. In determining whether to exclude a victim, the court must make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and must consider reasonable alternatives to exclusion. The reasons for any exclusion must be clearly stated on the record.

  * (3) _Right to Be Heard on Release, a Plea, or Sentencing._ The court must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning release, plea, or sentencing involving the crime.


* (b) ENFORCEMENT AND LIMITATIONS.

  * (1) _Time for Deciding a Motion._ The court must promptly decide any motion asserting a victim's rights described in these rules.

  * (2) _Who May Assert the Rights._ A victim's rights described in these rules may be asserted by the victim, the victim's lawful representative, the attorney for the government, or any other person as authorized by 18 U.S.C. §3771(d) and (e).

  * (3) _Multiple Victims._ If the court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of them their rights described in these rules, the court must fashion a reasonable procedure that gives effect to these rights without unduly complicating or prolonging the proceedings.

  * (4) _Where Rights May Be Asserted._ A victim's rights described in these rules must be asserted in the district where a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime.

  * (5) _Limitations on Relief._ A victim may move to reopen a plea or sentence only if:

    * (A) the victim asked to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue, and the request was denied;

    * (B) the victim petitions the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus within 10 days after the denial, and the writ is granted; and

    * (C) in the case of a plea, the accused has not pleaded to the highest offense charged.


  * (6) _No New Trial._ A failure to afford a victim any right described in these rules is not grounds for a new trial.

### Rule 61. Title
* These rules may be known and cited as the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
