  * (4) a person to be arrested or a person who is unlawfully restrained.


* (d) OBTAINING A WARRANT.

  * (1) _In General._ After receiving an affidavit or other information, a magistrate judge—or if authorized by Rule 41(b), a judge of a state court of record—must issue the warrant if there is probable cause to search for and seize a person or property or to install and use a tracking device.

  * (2) _Requesting a Warrant in the Presence of a Judge._

    * (A) _Warrant on an Affidavit_. When a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government presents an affidavit in support of a warrant, the judge may require the affiant to appear personally and may examine under oath the affiant and any witness the affiant produces.

    * (B) _Warrant on Sworn Testimony_. The judge may wholly or partially dispense with a written affidavit and base a warrant on sworn testimony if doing so is reasonable under the circumstances.

    * (C) _Recording Testimony_. Testimony taken in support of a warrant must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device, and the judge must file the transcript or recording with the clerk, along with any affidavit.


  * (3) _Requesting a Warrant by Telephonic or Other Reliable Electronic Means._ In accordance with Rule 4.1, a magistrate judge may issue a warrant based on information communicated by telephone or other reliable electronic means.


* (e) ISSUING THE WARRANT.

  * (1) _In General._ The magistrate judge or a judge of a state court of record must issue the warrant to an officer authorized to execute it.

  * (2) _Contents of the Warrant._

    * (A) _Warrant to Search for and Seize a Person or Property._ Except for a tracking-device warrant, the warrant must identify the person or property to be searched, identify any person or property to be seized, and designate the magistrate judge to whom it must be returned. The warrant must command the officer to:

      * (i) execute the warrant within a specified time no longer than 14 days;

      * (ii) execute the warrant during the daytime, unless the judge for good cause expressly authorizes execution at another time; and

      * (iii) return the warrant to the magistrate judge designated in the warrant.


    * (B) _Warrant Seeking Electronically Stored Information._ A warrant under Rule 41(e)(2)(A) may authorize the seizure of electronic storage media or the seizure or copying of electronically stored information. Unless otherwise specified, the warrant authorizes a later review of the media or information consistent with the warrant. The time for executing the warrant in Rule 41(e)(2)(A) and (f)(1)(A) refers to the seizure or on-site copying of the media or information, and not to any later off-site copying or review.

    * (C) _Warrant for a Tracking Device._ A tracking-device warrant must identify the person or property to be tracked, designate the magistrate judge to whom it must be returned, and specify a reasonable length of time that the device may be used. The time must not exceed 45 days from the date the warrant was issued. The court may, for good cause, grant one or more extensions for a reasonable period not to exceed 45 days each. The warrant must command the officer to:

      * (i) complete any installation authorized by the warrant within a specified time no longer than 10 days;

      * (ii) perform any installation authorized by the warrant during the daytime, unless the judge for good cause expressly authorizes installation at another time; and

      * (iii) return the warrant to the judge designated in the warrant.


* (f) EXECUTING AND RETURNING THE WARRANT.

  * (1) _Warrant to Search for and Seize a Person or Property._

    * (A) _Noting the Time._ The officer executing the warrant must enter on it the exact date and time it was executed.

    * (B) _Inventory._ An officer present during the execution of the warrant must prepare and verify an inventory of any property seized. The officer must do so in the presence of another officer and the person from whom, or from whose premises, the property was taken. If either one is not present, the officer must prepare and verify the inventory in the presence of at least one other credible person. In a case involving the seizure of electronic storage media or the seizure or copying of electronically stored information, the inventory may be limited to describing the physical storage media that were seized or copied. The officer may retain a copy of the electronically stored information that was seized or copied.

    * (C) _Receipt._ The officer executing the warrant must give a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken to the person from whom, or from whose premises, the property was taken or leave a copy of the warrant and receipt at the place where the officer took the property. For a warrant to use remote access to search electronic storage media and seize or copy electronically stored information, the officer must make reasonable efforts to serve a copy of the warrant and receipt on the person whose property was searched or who possessed the information that was seized or copied. Service may be accomplished by any means, including electronic means, reasonably calculated to reach that person.

    * (D) _Return._ The officer executing the warrant must promptly return it—together with a copy of the inventory—to the magistrate judge designated on the warrant. The officer may do so by reliable electronic means. The judge must, on request, give a copy of the inventory to the person from whom, or from whose premises, the property was taken and to the applicant for the warrant.


  * (2) _Warrant for a Tracking Device._

    * (A) _Noting the Time._ The officer executing a tracking-device warrant must enter on it the exact date and time the device was installed and the period during which it was used.

    * (B) _Return._ Within 10 days after the use of the tracking device has ended, the officer executing the warrant must return it to the judge designated in the warrant. The officer may do so by reliable electronic means.

    * (C) _Service._ Within 10 days after the use of the tracking device has ended, the officer executing a tracking-device warrant must serve a copy of the warrant on the person who was tracked or whose property was tracked. Service may be accomplished by delivering a copy to the person who, or whose property, was tracked; or by leaving a copy at the person's residence or usual place of abode with an individual of suitable age and discretion who resides at that location and by mailing a copy to the person's last known address. Upon request of the government, the judge may delay notice as provided in Rule 41(f)(3).


  * (3) _Delayed Notice._ Upon the government's request, a magistrate judge—or if authorized by Rule 41(b), a judge of a state court of record—may delay any notice required by this rule if the delay is authorized by statute.


* (g) MOTION TO RETURN PROPERTY. A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property may move for the property's return. The motion must be filed in the district where the property was seized. The court must receive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If it grants the motion, the court must return the property to the movant, but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access to the property and its use in later proceedings.

* (h) MOTION TO SUPPRESS. A defendant may move to suppress evidence in the court where the trial will occur, as Rule 12 provides.

* (i) FORWARDING PAPERS TO THE CLERK. The magistrate judge to whom the warrant is returned must attach to the warrant a copy of the return, of the inventory, and of all other related papers and must deliver them to the clerk in the district where the property was seized.

### Rule 42. Criminal Contempt
* (a) DISPOSITION AFTER NOTICE. Any person who commits criminal contempt may be punished for that contempt after prosecution on notice.

  * (1) _Notice._ The court must give the person notice in open court, in an order to show cause, or in an arrest order. The notice must:

    * (A) state the time and place of the trial;

    * (B) allow the defendant a reasonable time to prepare a defense; and

    * (C) state the essential facts constituting the charged criminal contempt and describe it as such.


  * (2) _Appointing a Prosecutor._ The court must request that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government, unless the interest of justice requires the appointment of another attorney. If the government declines the request, the court must appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt.

  * (3) _Trial and Disposition._ A person being prosecuted for criminal contempt is entitled to a jury trial in any case in which federal law so provides and must be released or detained as Rule 46 provides. If the criminal contempt involves disrespect toward or criticism of a judge, that judge is disqualified from presiding at the contempt trial or hearing unless the defendant consents. Upon a finding or verdict of guilty, the court must impose the punishment.


* (b) SUMMARY DISPOSITION. Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, the court (other than a magistrate judge) may summarily punish a person who commits criminal contempt in its presence if the judge saw or heard the contemptuous conduct and so certifies; a magistrate judge may summarily punish a person as provided in 28 U.S.C. §636(e). The contempt order must recite the facts, be signed by the judge, and be filed with the clerk.
