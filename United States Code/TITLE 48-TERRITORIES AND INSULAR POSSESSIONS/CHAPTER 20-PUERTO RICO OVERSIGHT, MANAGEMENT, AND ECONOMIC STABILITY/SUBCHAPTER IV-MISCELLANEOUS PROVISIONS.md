#### (i) Government of Puerto Rico
* For purposes of this section, the term "Government of Puerto Rico", in addition to the definition set forth in section 2104(11) of this title, shall include—

  * (1) the individuals, including elected and appointed officials, directors, officers of and employees acting in their official capacity on behalf of the Government of Puerto Rico; and

  * (2) the Oversight Board, including the directors and officers of and employees acting in their official capacity on behalf of the Oversight Board.

  * (B) with respect to Liability Claims—

    * (i) for the non-payment of principal or interest; or

    * (ii) for the breach of any condition or covenant.


* (2) The term "remedy" as used in paragraph (1) shall be interpreted broadly, and shall include any right existing in law or contract, including any right to—

  * (A) setoff;

  * (B) apply or appropriate funds;

  * (C) seek the appointment of a custodian (as such term is defined in section 101(11) of title 11);

  * (D) seek to raise rates; or

  * (E) exercise control over property of the Government of Puerto Rico.


* (3) Notwithstanding any contractual provision or applicable law to the contrary and so long as a stay under this section is in effect, a contract to which the Government of Puerto Rico is a party may not be terminated or modified, and any right or obligation under such contract may not be terminated or modified, solely because of a provision in such contract is conditioned on—

  * (A) the insolvency or financial condition of the Government of Puerto Rico at any time prior to the enactment of this chapter;

  * (B) the adoption of a resolution or establishment of an Oversight Board pursuant to section 2121 of this title; or

  * (C) a default under a separate contract that is due to, triggered by, or a result of the occurrence of the events or matters in paragraph (1)(B).


* (4) Notwithstanding any contractual provision to the contrary and so long as a stay under this section is in effect, a counterparty to a contract with the Government of Puerto Rico for the provision of goods and services shall, unless the Government of Puerto Rico agrees to the contrary in writing, continue to perform all obligations under, and comply with the terms of, such contract, provided that the Government of Puerto Rico is not in default under such contract other than as a result of a condition specified in paragraph (3).

#### (k) Effect
* This section does not discharge an obligation of the Government of Puerto Rico or release, invalidate, or impair any security interest or lien securing such obligation. This section does not impair or affect the implementation of any restructuring support agreement executed by the Government of Puerto Rico to be implemented pursuant to Puerto Rico law specifically enacted for that purpose prior to the enactment of this chapter or the obligation of the Government of Puerto Rico to proceed in good faith as set forth in any such agreement.

#### (l) Payments on Liabilities
* Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Government of Puerto Rico from making any payment on any Liability when such payment becomes due during the term of the stay, and to the extent the Oversight Board, in its sole discretion, determines it is feasible, the Government of Puerto Rico shall make interest payments on outstanding indebtedness when such payments become due during the length of the stay.

#### (m) Findings
* Congress finds the following:

  * (1) A combination of severe economic decline, and, at times, accumulated operating deficits, lack of financial transparency, management inefficiencies, and excessive borrowing has created a fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico.

  * (2) As a result of its fiscal emergency, the Government of Puerto Rico has been unable to provide its citizens with effective services.

  * (3) The current fiscal emergency has also affected the long-term economic stability of Puerto Rico by contributing to the accelerated outmigration of residents and businesses.

  * (4) A comprehensive approach to fiscal, management, and structural problems and adjustments that exempts no part of the Government of Puerto Rico is necessary, involving independent oversight and a Federal statutory authority for the Government of Puerto Rico to restructure debts in a fair and orderly process.

  * (5) Additionally, an immediate—but temporary—stay is essential to stabilize the region for the purposes of resolving this territorial crisis.

    * (A) The stay advances the best interests common to all stakeholders, including but not limited to a functioning independent Oversight Board created pursuant to this chapter to determine whether to appear or intervene on behalf of the Government of Puerto Rico in any litigation that may have been commenced prior to the effectiveness or upon expiration of the stay.

    * (B) The stay is limited in nature and narrowly tailored to achieve the purposes of this chapter, including to ensure all creditors have a fair opportunity to consensually renegotiate terms of repayment based on accurate financial information that is reviewed by an independent authority or, at a minimum, receive a recovery from the Government of Puerto Rico equal to their best possible outcome absent the provisions of this chapter.


  * (6) Finally, the ability of the Government of Puerto Rico to obtain funds from capital markets in the future will be severely diminished without congressional action to restore its financial accountability and stability.

#### (n) Purposes
* The purposes of this section are to—

  * (1) provide the Government of Puerto Rico with the resources and the tools it needs to address an immediate existing and imminent crisis;

  * (2) allow the Government of Puerto Rico a limited period of time during which it can focus its resources on negotiating a voluntary resolution with its creditors instead of defending numerous, costly creditor lawsuits;

  * (3) provide an oversight mechanism to assist the Government of Puerto Rico in reforming its fiscal governance and support the implementation of potential debt restructuring;

  * (4) make available a Federal restructuring authority, if necessary, to allow for an orderly adjustment of all of the Government of Puerto Rico's liabilities; and

  * (5) benefit the lives of 3.5 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico by encouraging the Government of Puerto Rico to resolve its longstanding fiscal governance issues and return to economic growth.

#### (o) Voting on voluntary agreements not stayed
* Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, nothing in this section shall prevent the holder of a Liability Claim from voting on or consenting to a proposed modification of such Liability Claim under subchapter VI of this chapter.

### §2195. Protection from inter-debtor transfers
#### (a) Protection of creditors
* While an Oversight Board for Puerto Rico is in existence, if any property of any territorial instrumentality of Puerto Rico is transferred in violation of applicable law under which any creditor has a valid pledge of, security interest in, or lien on such property, or which deprives any such territorial instrumentality of property in violation of applicable law assuring the transfer of such property to such territorial instrumentality for the benefit of its creditors, then the transferee shall be liable for the value of such property.

#### (b) Enforceability
* A creditor may enforce rights under this section by bringing an action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico after the expiration or lifting of the stay of section 2194 of this title, unless a stay under subchapter III is in effect.
