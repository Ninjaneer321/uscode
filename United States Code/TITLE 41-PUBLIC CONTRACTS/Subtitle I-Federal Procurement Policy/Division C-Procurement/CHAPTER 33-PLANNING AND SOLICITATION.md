* (a) EXCLUSION OF PARTICULAR SOURCE.—

  * (1) CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION.—An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by section 3301 of this title using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source to establish or maintain an alternative source of supply for that property or service if the agency head determines that to do so would—

    * (A) increase or maintain competition and likely result in reduced overall cost for the procurement, or for an anticipated procurement, of the property or services;

    * (D) ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of the property or service;

    * (E) satisfy projected needs for the property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or

### §3304. Use of noncompetitive procedures
* (a) WHEN NONCOMPETITIVE PROCEDURES MAY BE USED.—An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when—

  * (1) the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency;

  * (2) the executive agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Federal Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;

  * (3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source—

    * (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization;

    * (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a Federally funded research and development center;

    * (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before a court, administrative tribunal, or agency, whether or not the expert is expected to testify; or

    * (D) to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;


  * (4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the Federal Government and a foreign government or an international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for that government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;

  * (5) subject to section 3105 of this title, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another executive agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial product for authorized resale;

  * (6) the disclosure of the executive agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or

  * (7) the head of the executive agency (who may not delegate the authority under this paragraph)—

    * (A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned; and

    * (B) notifies Congress in writing of that determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.


* (b) PROPERTY OR SERVICES DEEMED AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE.—For the purposes of subsection (a)(1), in the case of—

  * (2) a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, the property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in—

    * (A) substantial duplication of cost to the Federal Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or

    * (B) unacceptable delay in fulfilling the executive agency's needs.


* (c) PROPERTY OR SERVICES NEEDED WITH UNUSUAL AND COMPELLING URGENCY.—

  * (1) ALLOWABLE CONTRACT PERIOD.—The contract period of a contract described in paragraph (2) that is entered into by an executive agency pursuant to the authority provided under subsection (a)(2)—

      * (i) exceeding $500,000 but equal to or less than $10,000,000, by the advocate for competition for the procuring activity (without further delegation) or by an official referred to in clause (ii) or (iii);

      * (ii) exceeding $10,000,000 but equal to or less than $50,000,000, by the head of the procuring activity or by a delegate who, if a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer or, if a civilian, is serving in a position in which the individual is entitled to receive the daily equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or

### §3308. Planning for future competition in contracts for major systems
* (a) DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT.—

  * (1) DETERMINING WHETHER PROPOSALS ARE NECESSARY.—In preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require the proposals, the head of the agency shall consider the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If the proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.

  * (2) CONTENTS OF PROPOSALS.—The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a development contract are the following:

    * (A) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items that are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.

    * (B) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items that the Federal Government will be able to acquire competitively in the future.


* (b) PRODUCTION CONTRACT.—

  * (1) DETERMINING WHETHER PROPOSALS ARE NECESSARY.—In preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require the proposals, the head of the agency shall consider the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If the proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.

  * (2) CONTENT OF PROPOSALS.—The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a production contract are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the Federal Government will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to this requirement may include the following:

    * (A) Proposals to provide to the Federal Government the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the Federal Government of acquiring the data and the right to use the data.

    * (B) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.


* (c) CONSIDERATION OF FACTORS AS OBJECTIVES IN NEGOTIATIONS.—If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in subsections (a) and (b) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded.

### §3309. Design-build selection procedures
* (a) AUTHORIZATION.—Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40 or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an executive agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) that the procedures are appropriate for use.

* (b) CRITERIA FOR USE.—A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when—

  * (1) the contracting officer anticipates that 3 or more offers will be received for the contract;

  * (2) design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for the contract;

  * (3) the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer; and

  * (4) the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:

    * (A) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.

    * (B) The time constraints for delivery of the project.

    * (C) The capability and experience of potential contractors.

    * (D) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.

    * (E) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.

    * (F) Other criteria established by the agency.


* (c) PROCEDURES DESCRIBED.—Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:

  * (1) DEVELOPMENT OF SCOPE OF WORK STATEMENT.—The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Federal Government's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals that meet the Federal Government's needs. If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40.

  * (2) SOLICITATION OF PHASE-ONE PROPOSALS.—The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that—

    * (A) include information on the offeror's—

      * (i) technical approach; and

      * (ii) technical qualifications; and


    * (B) do not include—

      * (i) detailed design information; or

      * (ii) cost or price information.


  * (3) EVALUATION FACTORS.—The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team), and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.

  * (4) SELECTION BY CONTRACTING OFFICER.—

    * (A) NUMBER OF OFFERORS SELECTED AND WHAT IS TO BE EVALUATED.—The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information. Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two—

      * (i) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work, or both; and

      * (ii) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with subsections (b) to (d) of section 3306 of this title.


    * (B) SEPARATE EVALUATIONS.—The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).


  * (5) AWARDING OF CONTRACT.—The agency awards the contract in accordance with chapter 37 of this title.


* (d) SOLICITATION TO STATE NUMBER OF OFFERORS TO BE SELECTED FOR PHASE-TWO REQUESTS FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.—A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4). The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Federal Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.

* (e) REQUIREMENT FOR GUIDANCE AND REGULATIONS.—The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance—

  * (1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;

  * (3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.

### §3310. Quantities to order
* (a) FACTORS AFFECTING QUANTITY TO ORDER.—Each executive agency shall procure supplies in a quantity that—

  * (1) will result in the total cost and unit cost most advantageous to the Federal Government, where practicable; and

  * (2) does not exceed the quantity reasonably expected to be required by the agency.


* (b) OFFEROR'S OPINION OF QUANTITY.—Each solicitation for a contract for supplies shall, if practicable, include a provision inviting each offeror responding to the solicitation to state an opinion on whether the quantity of supplies proposed to be procured is economically advantageous to the Federal Government and, if applicable, to recommend a quantity that would be more economically advantageous to the Federal Government. Each recommendation shall include a quotation of the total price and the unit price for supplies procured in each recommended quantity.

### §3311. Qualification requirement
* (a) DEFINITION.—In this section, the term "qualification requirement" means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.

* (b) ACTIONS BEFORE ENFORCING QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENT.—Except as provided in subsection (c), the head of an agency, before enforcing any qualification requirement, shall—

  * (1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;

  * (2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror on request all requirements that a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy to become qualified, with those requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;

  * (3) specify an estimate of the cost of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror to become qualified;

  * (4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, on request, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate at its own expense (except as provided in subsection (d)) its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using—

    * (A) qualified personnel and facilities—

      * (i) of the agency concerned;

      * (ii) of another agency obtained through interagency agreement; or

      * (iii) under contract; or


    * (B) other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);


  * (5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of paragraph (4), provide to the extent possible that those services be provided by a contractor that—

    * (A) is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources; and

    * (B) is required in the contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and


  * (6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed whether qualification is attained and, if not attained, is promptly furnished specific information about why qualification was not attained.


* (c) APPLICABILITY, WAIVER AUTHORITY, AND REFERRAL OF OFFERS.—

  * (1) APPLICABILITY.—Subsection (b) does not apply to a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984.

  * (2) WAIVER AUTHORITY.—

    * (A) SUBMISSION OF DETERMINATION OF UNREASONABLENESS.—Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification that a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement.

    * (B) AUTHORITY TO GRANT WAIVER.—After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing the determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2) to (5) of subsection (b) for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.

    * (C) NONAPPLICABILITY TO QUALIFIED PRODUCTS LIST.—Waiver authority under this paragraph does not apply with respect to a qualified products list.


  * (3) SUBMISSION AND CONSIDERATION OF OFFER NOT TO BE DENIED.—A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet those standards before the date specified for award of the contract.

  * (4) REFERRAL TO SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION NOT REQUIRED.—This subsection does not require the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)) if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with that requirement.

  * (5) DELAY OF PROCUREMENT NOT REQUIRED.—The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement to comply with subsection (b) or to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.


* (d) FEWER THAN 2 ACTUAL MANUFACTURERS.—

  * (1) SOLICITATION AND TESTING OF ADDITIONAL SOURCES OR PRODUCTS.—If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than 2 actual manufacturers or the products of 2 actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall—

    * (A) publish notice periodically soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that doing so would compromise national security; and

    * (B) subject to paragraph (2), bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the cost associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern that has met the standards specified for qualification and that could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement.


  * (2) WHEN AGENCY MAY BEAR COST.—The head of the agency concerned may bear the cost under paragraph (1)(B) only if the head of the agency determines that the additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to offset (within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements) the cost incurred by the agency.

  * (3) CERTIFICATION REQUIRED.—The head of the agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the Federal Government to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify its status as a small business concern under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).


* (e) EXAMINATION AND REVALIDATION OF QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENT.—Within 7 years after the establishment of a qualification requirement, the need for the requirement shall be examined and the standards of the requirement revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b). This subsection does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2).

* (f) WHEN ENFORCEMENT OF QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENT NOT ALLOWED.—Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, after the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not enforce the requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b).
