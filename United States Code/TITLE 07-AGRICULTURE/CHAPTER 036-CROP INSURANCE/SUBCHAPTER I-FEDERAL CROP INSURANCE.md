      * For purposes of determining whether the per planted acre yield of the agricultural commodity in the county of the producer was at least 50 percent below the simple average of the per planted acre yield of the agricultural commodity in the county during the previous 10 consecutive crop years, the Corporation shall make a separate determination for irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.

  * #### (D) Premium adjustment
    * In the case of a producer that makes an election under subparagraph (B) or (C), the Corporation shall adjust the premium to reflect the risk associated with the adjustment made in the actual production history of the producer.

* #### (5) Adjustment to reflect increased yields from successful pest control efforts
  * #### (A) Situations justifying adjustment
    * The Corporation shall develop a methodology for adjusting the actual production history of a producer when each of the following apply:
