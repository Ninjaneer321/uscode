### **CHAPTER 68—AGRICULTURAL SUBTERMINAL FACILITIES**

### §3701. Congressional findings and declarations

  * (1) an adequate system for the efficient transient storage and movement of bulk agricultural commodities is essential to the overall success of the agricultural industry of the Nation, the development of rural areas of the Nation, and the economic stability of the Nation;

  * (2) the movement and storage of bulk agricultural commodities has been seriously and repeatedly impeded by shortages of transient storage facilities, adequate rail rolling stock, and the deterioration of many railroad track beds and rural highways throughout the United States;

  * (3) the efficient movement and storage of bulk agricultural commodities may be achieved and facilitated by the joint location at strategic points throughout the United States of transient storage facilities and multimodal terminal facilities constructed especially for the efficient shipment and receipt of agricultural commodities; and

  * (4) the location of such facilities must be carefully planned to assure maximum benefits to producers of agricultural commodities and unprocessed agricultural products and utilization of the most efficient means of transporting bulk agricultural commodities for domestic and export markets.

### §3702. Definitions

  * (5) "region" means two or more States acting together to develop a coordinated regional subterminal facilities plan.

### §3703. State and regional plans
#### (a) Grants; requisite provisions of plans
* (1) The Secretary shall, beginning not more than one hundred and eighty days after October 1, 1980, make financial assistance available to any State that makes application therefor, and that otherwise meets the requirements of this section, for the purpose of assisting such State in the development of a subterminal facilities plan (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the "State plan") for such State. Assistance under this section shall be made available in the form of a grant. No grant may be made to any State unless the Governor of such State or the appropriate agency of such State makes an application therefor as provided in this section. To the maximum extent practicable, the personnel and resources of the colleges or universities in the State which are eligible to receive funds under the Act of July 2, 1862 (7 U.S.C. 301–305, 307, and 308), or the Act of August 30, 1890 (7 U.S.C. 321–326 and 328), including Tuskegee Institute, shall be utilized in developing the subterminal facilities plan for that State pursuant to this section.

* (2) The Secretary may also make grants under this section available to two or more States acting together to develop a coordinated regional subterminal facilities plan (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the "regional plan") for such region.

* (3) Grants made under this section to any State or region may not exceed 80 per centum of the cost of preparing the State or regional plan.

* (4) The State or regional plan shall prescribe in detail the actions such State or region proposes to take in order to (A) facilitate the efficient and competitive movement of bulk agricultural commodities from the points of production within such State or region to major market or export points, (B) provide adequate storage facilities for such commodities between points of production and market, (C) provide adequate receiving, storage, and loading facilities for any bulk agricultural commodity, and (D) assure that such facilities will be located at sites that will result in maximum benefits to local producers.

* (5) Each State or regional plan shall include the following:

  * (A) an analysis of the marketing, shipping, storage, and production of bulk agricultural commodities produced in that State or region and the short- and long-range projections with respect to the marketing, shipping, storage, and production of such commodities in that State or region;

  * (B) a determination, on the basis of the analysis and projections required under clause (A) of this paragraph, of the needs of the State or region for subterminal facilities;

  * (C) an assessment of the use of existing on-farm storage facilities located within the State or region and an assessment of the ways in which subterminal facilities can benefit the continued use of on-farm storage facilities;

  * (D) an evaluation of the effect of the development of new subterminal facilities on small capacity rural shipping and storage facilities within the State or region;

  * (E) an evaluation of ways to ensure adequate rail service for subterminal facilities described in clause (D) of this paragraph, including an evaluation of the use and feasibility of contract rates;

  * (F) an assessment of the ways that subterminal facilities can enhance the operation of small capacity shipping and storage facilities within the State or region;

  * (G) an assessment of other actions being taken or considered in such State or region for the improvement of agricultural transportation, including an evaluation of the use being made of shuttle or collector trains and combinations of rail and barge service;

  * (H) an evaluation of the potential benefits of subterminal ownership and leasing arrangements for rail rolling stock (including locomotive power), motor trucks, barge equipment, and other bulk agricultural commodity transport equipment that may help achieve maximum benefits from the operation of subterminal facilities within the State or region;

  * (I) an assessment of the overall transportation system in the State or region and future plans for that overall system, including the adequacy of highways and bridges; and

  * (J) consideration of the feasibility and advisability of the ownership and operation of rail branch lines by farmer-owned cooperatives, and the role that such cooperatives might play in any overall planning for the restructuring and rehabilitation of rail service and marketing facilities within the State or region.
