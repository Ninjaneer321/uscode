### SUBCHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS

### §1421. Price support
#### (a) Source
* The Secretary shall provide the price support authorized or required herein through the Commodity Credit Corporation and other means available to him.

#### (b) Authority of Secretary; factors considered
* Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the amounts, terms, and conditions of price support operations and the extent to which such operations are carried out, shall be determined or approved by the Secretary. The following factors shall be taken into consideration in determining, in the case of any commodity for which price support is discretionary, whether a price-support operation shall be undertaken and the level of such support and, in the case of any commodity for which price support is mandatory, the level of support in excess of the minimum level prescribed for such commodity: (1) the supply of the commodity in relation to the demand therefor, (2) the price levels at which other commodities are being supported and, in the case of feed grains, the feed values of such grains in relation to corn, (3) the availability of funds, (4) the perishability of the commodity, (5) the importance of the commodity to agriculture and the national economy, (6) the ability to dispose of stocks acquired through a price-support operation, (7) the need for offsetting temporary losses of export markets, (8) the ability and willingness of producers to keep supplies in line with demand and (9), in the case of upland cotton, changes in the cost of producing such cotton.

#### (c) Compliance by producer; program for diverted acres
* Compliance by the producer with acreage allotments, production goals and marketing practices (including marketing quotas when authorized by law), prescribed by the Secretary, may be required as a condition of eligibility for price support. In administering any program for diverted acres the Secretary may make his regulations applicable on an appropriate geographical basis. Such regulations shall be administered (1) in semiarid or other areas where good husbandry requires maintenance of a prudent feed reserve in such manner as to permit, to the extent so required by good husbandry, the production of forage crops for storage and subsequent use either on the farm or in feeding operations of the farm operator, and (2) in areas declared to be disaster areas by the President under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.], in such manner as will most quickly restore the normal pattern of their agriculture.

#### (d) Time of determining levels
* The level of price support for any commodity shall be determined upon the basis of its parity price as of the beginning of the marketing year or season in the case of any commodity marketed on a marketing year or season basis and as of January 1 in the case of any other commodity.

#### (e) Processors' assurances; payment if assurances inadequate
* (1) Whenever any price support or surplus removal operation for any agricultural commodity is carried out through purchases from or loans or payments to processors, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, obtain from the processors such assurances as he deems adequate that the producers of the agricultural commodity involved have received or will receive maximum benefits from the price support or surplus removal operation.

* (2)(A) If the assurances under paragraph (1) are not adequate to cause the producers of sugar beets and sugarcane, because of the bankruptcy or other insolvency of the processor, to receive maximum benefits from the price support program within 30 days after the final settlement date provided for in the contract between such producers and processor, the Secretary, on demand made by such producers and on such assurances as to nonpayment as the Secretary shall require, shall pay such producers such maximum benefits less benefits previously received by such producers.

* (B) On such payment, the Secretary shall—

  * (i) be subrogated to all claims of such producers against the processor and other persons responsible for nonpayment; and

  * (ii) have authority to pursue such claims as necessary to recover the benefits not paid to the producers.


* (C) The Secretary shall carry out this paragraph through the Commodity Credit Corporation.

### §1421a. Financial impact study
#### (a) Study
* The Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct an annual study of the financial impact of the support levels established and announced by the Secretary under programs contained in the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.] (hereafter in this section referred to as "programs"), including a study of the effect of the support levels on the ability of producers to meet their financial obligations (with special emphasis on borrowers from the Farmers Home Administration and the Farm Credit System).

#### (b) Report
* The Secretary shall annually prepare a report containing the results of the study and submit the report to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate, not later than the date of the final announcement for the programs by the Secretary for any 1 year.

#### (c) Informational purposes
* The study under this section (including the study of the effect of the support levels on the ability of producers to meet their financial obligations) shall be only for informational purposes and for Congressional oversight and shall not give rise to any cause of action, be a basis for, or be used as evidence in support of, any claim or right of any person, including farmers and borrowers, in any administrative or judicial proceeding.

### §1421b. Costs of production
* Congress finds that, to improve the accuracy of commodity program benefit forecasts, the Secretary of Agriculture should designate a single organization to manage its commodity program forecasting and establish a quality control program to—

  * (1) systematically identify the source of forecasting errors;

  * (2) maintain records of data used for supply and demand forecasts;

  * (3) document its forecasting methods; and

  * (4) correct weaknesses in its various forecasting components.

### §1421d. Commodity reports
#### (a) Crop reports
* The Secretary of Agriculture (hereafter in this section referred to as the "Secretary") shall gather data from producers to be used to develop crop reports to be distributed by the Secretary during the growing season. The report shall contain statements of the conditions of those crops by State, with such explanations, comparisons, and information as may be useful for illustrating such reports.

#### (b) Special reports
* #### (1) In general

#### (d) Omitted
#### (e) Authorization
* There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.

### §1422. Increase of price support levels
* (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, price support at a level in excess of the maximum level of price support otherwise prescribed in this Act may be made available for any agricultural commodity if the Secretary determines, after a public hearing of which reasonable notice has been given, that price support at such increased level is necessary in order to prevent or alleviate a shortage in the supply of any agricultural commodity essential to the national welfare or in order to increase or maintain the production of any agricultural commodity in the interest of national security. The Secretary's determination and the record of the hearing shall be available to the public.

* (b) Effective only for the 1991 through 1995 crops of wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice, the Secretary of Agriculture may provide for annual adjustments in the established prices for such program crops to reflect any change during the last calendar year ending before the beginning of each such crop year in the index of prices paid by farmers for production items, interest, taxes, and wage rates in such calendar year.

### §1423. Adjustments of support prices
#### (a) In general
* The Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the support price for any commodity (excluding cotton) for differences in grade, type, quality, location and other factors. The adjustments shall, so far as practicable, be made in such manner that the average support price for the commodity will, on the basis of the anticipated incidence of such factors be equal to the level of support determined as provided in this Act. Beginning with the 1991 crops of wheat, feed grains, and soybeans for which price support is provided under this Act, the Secretary shall establish premiums and discounts related to cleanliness factors in addition to any other premiums or discounts related to quality.

#### (b) Adjustment in support prices for cotton
* The Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the support price for cotton for differences in quality factors and location. Beginning with the 1991 crop, the quality differences (premiums and discounts for quality factors) for the upland cotton loan program shall be established by the Secretary by giving equal weight to (1) loan differences for the preceding crop, and (2) market differences for such crop in the designated United States spot markets.

#### (c) Limitation on adjustments for wheat and feed grains
* Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for each of the 1990 through 1995 crops of wheat and feed grains, no adjustment in the loan rate applicable to a particular region, State, or county for the purpose of reflecting transportation differentials may increase or decrease the regional, State, or county loan rate from the level established for the previous year by more than the percentage change in the national average loan rate plus or minus 3 percent.

### §1424. Utilization of services and facilities of Commodity Credit Corporation
* The Secretary, in carrying out programs under section 612c of this title and section 1755 of title 42, may utilize the services and facilities of the Commodity Credit Corporation (including but not limited to procurement by contract), and make advance payments to it.

### §1425. Producer rights and liabilities
#### (a) Liability for deficiencies
* Except as otherwise provided in section 1425a of this title, no producer shall be personally liable for any deficiency arising from the sale of the collateral securing any loan made under authority of this Act unless such loan was obtained through fraudulent representations by the producer. This provision shall not, however, be construed to prevent the Commodity Credit Corporation or the Secretary from requiring producers to assume liability for deficiencies in the grade, quality, or quantity of commodities stored on the farm or delivered by them, for failure properly to care for and preserve commodities, or for failure or refusal to deliver commodities in accordance with the requirements of the program. There is authorized to be included in the terms and conditions of any such nonrecourse loan a provision whereby on and after the maturity of the loan or any extension thereof Commodity Credit Corporation shall have the right to acquire title to the unredeemed collateral without obligation to pay for any market value which such collateral may have in excess of the loan indebtedness.

#### (b) Sugarcane and sugar beets
* The security interests obtained by the Commodity Credit Corporation as a result of the execution of security agreements by the processors of sugarcane and sugar beets shall be superior to all statutory and common law liens on raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar in favor of the producers of sugarcane and sugar beets and all prior recorded and unrecorded liens on the crops of sugarcane and sugar beets from which the sugar was derived. The preceding sentence shall not affect the application of section 1421(e)(2) of this title.

### §1425a. Producers of honey; loan obligations and liabilities
#### (a) Loan forfeiture limitation
* A producer of honey may satisfy the producer's obligation to repay a loan, or a portion of a loan, made to the producer under section 1446h of this title by forfeiting the collateral for the loan, or portion of the loan, only if the value of the collateral forfeited, when taken together with the value of the collateral forfeited on any other loan or loans of the person for such crop of honey under section 1446h of this title, does not exceed $200,000 in the 1991 crop year, $175,000 in the 1992 crop year, $150,000 in the 1993 crop year, and $125,000 in each of the 1994 and subsequent crop years: _Provided, however_, That the loan forfeiture limitation provided by this section shall not be applicable for any crop year for which the Secretary does not permit producers of honey to repay the price support loans at a level determined under section 1446h(b)(2) of this title.

#### (b) Liability for nonforfeitable part of obligation
* The producer of honey shall be personally liable for the repayment of a loan or loans made to the producer under the program for the crop of honey involved, with respect to that portion of the loan or loans for which satisfaction of the loan by forfeiture, as provided in subsection (a), is prohibited.

#### (c) Extent of personal liability
* The loan contracts of the Commodity Credit Corporation entered into with producers of honey shall clearly indicate the extent to which a producer of honey may be personally liable for repayment of a loan under this section.

#### (d) Promulgation of regulations

#### (c) Sales price restrictions
* #### (1) In general
  * Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Corporation shall not sell any basic agricultural commodity or storable nonbasic commodity at less than 115 percent of the lower of—

    * (B) the loan repayment level.

* #### (2) Extra long staple cotton
  * The Corporation may sell extra long staple cotton for unrestricted use at such price as the Corporation determines is appropriate to maintain and expand export and domestic markets.

    * (A) make available any farm commodity or product thereof owned or controlled by the Corporation for use in relieving distress—

      * (i) in any area in the United States (including the Virgin Islands) declared by the President to be an acute distress area because of unemployment or other economic cause, if the President finds that the use will not displace or interfere with normal marketing of agricultural commodities; and

      * (ii) in connection with any major disaster determined by the President to warrant assistance by the Federal Government under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.); and

### §1427–1. Quality requirements for Commodity Credit Corporation owned grain
#### (a) Establishment of minimum standards
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall establish minimum quality standards that shall apply to grain that is deposited for storage for the account of the Commodity Credit Corporation. In establishing such standards, the Secretary shall take into consideration factors related to the ability of grain to withstand storage and assurance of acceptable end-use performance.

#### (b) Inspection of grain acquisitions
* The Commodity Credit Corporation shall utilize Federal Grain Inspection Service approved procedures to inspect and evaluate the condition of the grain it acquires from producers. In no case shall this section require the use of an official inspection unless the producer so requests.

In the case of clause (3) the Secretary shall obtain such assurance as he deems necessary that the recipients thereof will not diminish their normal expenditures for food by reason of such donation. In order to facilitate the appropriate disposal of such commodities, the Secretary may from time to time estimate and announce the quantity of such commodities which he anticipates will become available for distribution under clause (3). The Commodity Credit Corporation may pay, with respect to commodities disposed of under this subsection, reprocessing, packaging, transporting, handling, and other charges accruing up to the time of their delivery to a Federal agency, or to the designated State or private agency. In addition, in the case of food commodities disposed of under this subsection, the Commodity Credit Corporation may pay the cost of processing such commodities into a form suitable for home or institutional use, such processing to be accomplished through private trade facilities to the greatest extent possible. For the purpose of this subsection the terms "State" and "United States" include the District of Columbia and any Territory or possession of the United States. Dairy products acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation through price support operations may, insofar as they can be used in the United States in nonprofit school lunch and other nonprofit child feeding programs, in the assistance of needy persons, and in charitable institutions, including hospitals, to the extent that needy persons are served, be donated for any such use prior to any other use or disposition. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such dairy products may be donated for distribution to needy households in the United States and to meet the needs of persons receiving nutrition assistance under the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.].

#### (b) Furnishing of eligible commodities for carrying out programs of assistance in developing and friendly countries; availability of eligible commodities for nonprofit and voluntary agencies and cooperatives
* (1) The Secretary, subject to the requirements of paragraph (10), may furnish eligible commodities for carrying out programs of assistance in developing countries and friendly countries under titles II and III of the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq., 1727 et seq.] and under the Food for Progress Act of 1985 [7 U.S.C. 1736o], as approved by the Secretary, and for such purposes as are approved by the Secretary. To ensure that the furnishing of commodities under this subsection is coordinated with and complements other United States foreign assistance, assistance under this subsection shall be coordinated through the mechanism designated by the President to coordinate assistance under the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.].

* (2) As used in this subsection, the term "eligible commodities" means—

  * (II) such disposition of the commodities will not interfere with usual marketings of the United States, nor disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities and normal patterns of commercial trade with developing countries.

* (B) The Commodity Credit Corporation may pay the processing and domestic handling costs incurred, as authorized under this subsection, in the form of eligible commodities, as defined in paragraph (2)(A), if the Secretary determines that such in-kind payment will not disrupt domestic markets.

The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to use available funds to operate the program under this subsection and to further process products to facilitate bonus commodity use. Commodities made available under this section shall include, but not be limited to, dairy products, wheat or the products thereof, rice, honey, and cornmeal.

* (2)(A) For each of fiscal years 2008 through 2023, whenever a commodity is made available without charge or credit under any nutrition program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary shall encourage consumption of such commodity through agreements with private companies under which the commodity is reprocessed into end-food products for use by eligible recipient agencies.

* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever a producer samples, turns, moves, or replaces grain or any other commodity which is security for a Commodity Credit Corporation producer loan or is held under a producer reserve program, and does so in violation of law or regulation, the appropriate county committee established under section 590h(b) of title 16 may forgive some or all of the penalties and requirements that would normally be imposed on the producer by reason of the violation, if such committee determines that (1) the violation occurred inadvertently or accidentally, because of lack of knowledge or understanding of the law or regulation, or because the producer or the producer's agent acted to prevent spoilage of the commodity, and (2) the violation did not result in harm or damage to the rights or interests of any person. The county committee shall furnish a copy of its determination to the Administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service and the appropriate State committee established under section 590h(b) of title 16.

* In determining the feasibility of providing for the processing of Commodity Credit Corporation stocks of commodities under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider the nature of the commodities, and the acquisition, transportation, handling, storage, interest, and other costs associated with acquiring and maintaining such stocks, including the effect of such stocks in depressing commodity prices, as well as the value and utility of such stocks when processed into liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts.

### §1433c. Advance recourse commodity loans
* Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Secretary may make advance recourse loans available to producers of the commodities of the 1986 through 1990 crops for which nonrecourse loans are made available under this Act if the Secretary finds that such action is necessary to ensure that adequate operating credit is available to producers. Such recourse loans may be made available under such reasonable terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, except that the Secretary shall require that a producer obtain crop insurance for the crop as a condition of eligibility for a loan.

### §1433c–1. Advance recourse loans
#### (a) Availability; due date; procedures for repayment; applicability; security; limitation
* It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture carry out a program authorized by section 424 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1433c]. Such program, if implemented, shall provide for the following:

  * (1) Advance recourse loans shall be made available only to those producers of a commodity who are unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance the production of the 1986 crop of that commodity, taking into consideration prevailing private and cooperative rates and terms for loans for similar purposes (as determined by the Secretary) in the community in or near which the applicant resides. A producer who has received a commitment or been furnished sufficient credit or a loan for production of the 1986 crop of a commodity shall not be eligible for an advance recourse loan to finance the production of that commodity for such crop year.

  * (2) Advance recourse loans shall be made available to producers of a commodity at the applicable nonrecourse loan rate for the commodity (as determined by the Secretary). Within the limits set out in paragraphs (5) and (7), advance recourse loans shall be available—

    * (A) to producers of wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice who agree to participate in the program announced for the commodity on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm program yield for the commodity multiplied by the farm program acreage intended to be planted to the commodity for harvest in 1986, as determined by the Secretary;

    * (B) to producers of peanuts who are on a farm for which a marketing quota or poundage quota has been established on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm marketing quota or poundage quota for the commodity, as determined by the Secretary; and

    * (C) to producers of other commodities on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm yield for the commodity multiplied by the farm acreage intended to be planted to the commodity for harvest in 1986, as determined by the Secretary.


  * (3) An advance recourse loan under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] shall come due at such time immediately following harvest as the Secretary determines appropriate. Each loan contract entered into under section 424 shall specify the date on which the loan is to come due.

  * (4)(A) The Secretary shall establish procedures, when practicable, under which a producer, simultaneously with repayment of his recourse loan, may obtain a nonrecourse loan on his crop (as otherwise provided for in the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.]) in an amount sufficient to repay his recourse loan.

  * (B) In cases in which nonrecourse loans under such Act are not normally made available directly to producers, the Secretary shall establish procedures under which a producer may repay a recourse loan at the same time the producer receives advances or other payment from the producer's disposition of his crop.

  * (5) Advance recourse loans shall be made available as needed solely to cover costs involved in the production of the 1986 crop that are incurred or are outstanding on or after March 20, 1986.

  * (6) To obtain an advance recourse loan, the producer on a farm must—

    * (A) provide as security for the loan a first lien on the crop covered by the loan or provide such other security as may be available to the producer and determined by the Secretary to be adequate to protect the Government's interests; and

    * (B) obtain multiperil crop insurance, if available, to protect the crop that serves as security for the loan.


* If a producer does not have multiperil crop insurance and is located in a county in which the signup period for multiperil crop insurance has expired, the producer shall be required to obtain other crop insurance, if available.

  * (7) The total amount in advance recourse loans that may be made to a producer under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] may not exceed $50,000.

  * (8) An advance recourse loan may be made available only to a producer who agrees to comply with such other terms and conditions determined appropriate by the Secretary and consistent with the provisions of section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c].

#### (b) Use of Commodity Credit Corporation, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, and county committees
* The Secretary shall carry out the program provided for under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] through the Commodity Credit Corporation, using the services of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service and the county committees established under section 590h(b) of title 16 to make determinations of eligibility with respect to the credit test under subsection (a)(1), and determinations as to the sufficiency of security under subsection (a)(6). The Secretary may use such committees for such other purposes as the Secretary determines appropriate in carrying out section 424.

#### (c) Regulations
* It is further the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture issue or, as appropriate, amend regulations to implement any program established under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after March 20, 1986. Loans and other assistance provided under such program shall be made available beginning on the date such regulations are issued or amended.

### §1434. Encouragement of production of crops of which United States is a net importer and for which price support programs are not in effect; authority to plant on set-aside acreage with no reduction in payment rate
* Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, the Secretary shall encourage the production of any crop of which the United States is a net importer and for which a price support program is not in effect by permitting the planting of such crop on set-aside acreage and with no reduction in the rate of payment for the commodity.

### §1435. Production of commodities for conversion into alcohol or hydrocarbons for use as motor fuels or other fuels; terms and conditions; determinations; payments, etc., for program
* (a) The Secretary of Agriculture shall permit, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe, all or any part of the acreage set aside or diverted under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.] from the production of a commodity for any crop year to be devoted to the production of any commodity for conversion into alcohol or hydrocarbons for use as motor fuel or other fuel, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that such production is desirable in order to provide an adequate supply of commodities for such conversion, is not likely to increase the cost of price support programs, and will not adversely affect farm income.

* (b)(1) During any year in which no set-aside or diversion of acreage is in effect under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], the Secretary of Agriculture may formulate and administer a program for the production, subject to such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, of commodities for conversion into alcohol or hydrocarbons for use as motor fuel or other fuel. Under such program, producers of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice shall be paid incentive payments to devote a portion of their acreage to such production.

* (2) The payments under this subsection shall be made at such rate or rates as the Secretary of Agriculture determines to be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the participation necessary to ensure an adequate supply of commodities for such conversion.

* (3) The Secretary may issue any regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.

* (4) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.

### §1436. Reimbursement of appropriations available for classing or grading agriculture commodities without charge
* On and after June 29, 1949, appropriations available for classing or grading any agricultural commodity without charge to the producers thereof may be reimbursed from nonadministrative funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation for the cost of classing or grading any such commodity for producers who obtain Commodity Credit Corporation price support.

### §1436a. Transfer of nonadministrative funds of Commodity Credit Corporation for classing and grading purposes
* On and after August 31, 1951, there may be transferred to appropriations available for classing or grading any agricultural commodity without charge to the producers thereof such sums from nonadministrative funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation as may be necessary in addition to other funds available for these purposes, such transfers to be reimbursed from subsequent appropriations therefor.
