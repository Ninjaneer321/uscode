### SUBCHAPTER III—NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL WEATHER INFORMATION SYSTEM

### §5851. Short title and purposes
#### (a) Short title
* This subchapter may be cited as the "National Agricultural Weather Information System Act of 1990".

#### (b) Purposes
* The purposes of this subchapter are—

  * (1) to provide a nationally coordinated agricultural weather information system, based on the participation of universities, State programs, Federal agencies, and the private weather consulting sector, and aimed at meeting the weather and climate information needs of agricultural producers;

  * (2) to facilitate the collection, organization, and dissemination of advisory weather and climate information relevant to agricultural producers, through the participation of the private sector and otherwise;

  * (3) to provide for research and education on agricultural weather and climate information, aimed at improving the quality and quantity of weather and climate information available to agricultural producers, including research on short-term forecasts of thunderstorms and on extended weather forecasting techniques and models;

  * (4) to encourage, where feasible, greater private sector participation in providing agricultural weather and climate information, to encourage private sector participation in educating and training farmers and others in the proper utilization of agricultural weather and climate information, and to strengthen their ability to provide site-specific weather forecasting for farmers and the agricultural sector in general; and

  * (5) to ensure that the weather and climate data bases needed by the agricultural sector are of the highest scientific accuracy and thoroughly documented, and that such data bases are easily accessible for remote computer access.

#### (d) Priority
* In selecting among applications for grants under subsection (c), the Secretary shall give priority to proposals which emphasize—

  * (1) techniques and processes that relate to weather-induced agricultural losses, and to improving the advisory information on weather extremes such as drought, floods, freezes, and storms well in advance of their actual occurrence;

  * (2) the improvement of site-specific weather data collection and forecasting; or

  * (3) the impact of weather on economic and environmental costs in agricultural production.

### §5854. State agricultural weather information systems
#### (a) Advisory program grants
* #### (1) Grants required
  * With funds allocated to carry out this section, the Secretary of Agriculture shall make grants to not fewer than 10 eligible States to plan and administer, in cooperation with persons described in paragraph (2), advisory programs for State agricultural weather information systems.

* #### (2) Persons described
  * The persons referred to in paragraph (1) are the Director of the Agricultural Weather Office, the Director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and other persons as appropriate (such as the directors of the appropriate State agricultural experiment stations and State extension programs).

#### (b) Consultation
* For purposes of selecting among applications submitted by States for grants under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Director.

#### (c) Eligibility requirements
* To be eligible to receive a grant under this section, the chief executive officer of a State shall submit to the Secretary an application that contains—

  * (1) assurances that the State will expend such grant to plan and administer a State agricultural weather system that will—

    * (A) collect observational weather data throughout the State and provide such data to the National Weather Service and the Agricultural Weather Office;

    * (B) develop methods for packaging information received from the national system for use by agricultural producers (with State Cooperative Extension Services and the private sector to serve as the primary conduit of agricultural weather forecasts and climatic information to producers); and

    * (C) develop programs to educate agricultural producers on how to best use weather and climate information to improve management decisions; and


  * (2) such other assurances and information as the Secretary may require by rule.
