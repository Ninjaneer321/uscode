### SUBCHAPTER III–B—EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE

### §1728. Findings regarding emergency food assistance
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) acute food crises continue to cause loss of life, severe malnutrition, and general human suffering in many areas of the Third World, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;

  * (2) the United States continues to respond to these needs, as a reflection of its humanitarian concern for the people of the Third World, with emergency food and other necessary assistance to alleviate the suffering of those affected by severe food shortages;

  * (3) the timely provision of food and other necessary assistance to those in need is of paramount importance if the worst effects of such food crises are to be mitigated; and

  * (4) the ability of the United States to provide food and other necessary assistance on a timely basis, and to ensure that such assistance is distributed to those in need, should be enhanced in order to better enable the United States to help those affected by severe food shortages.

### §1728a. President's Emergency Food Assistance Fund
#### (a) Establishment; authority of President to furnish assistance from Fund
* There is hereby established the President's Emergency Food Assistance Fund (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the "Fund"). Whenever the President determines it to be in the national interest of the United States, he is authorized to furnish, in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, and on such terms and conditions as he may determine, assistance from the Fund for the purpose of alleviating the human suffering of peoples outside the United States caused by acute food shortages. Such assistance may be provided through such governments or other entities, private or public, including intergovernmental and multilateral organizations, as the President deems appropriate.

#### (b) Types of assistance authorized
* Because the effects of severe food shortages will vary with the country or region, assistance to alleviate human suffering may include the provision of food assistance or such activities as the provision of seed, animal fodder, animal vaccines, and transportation (including inland transportation) and distribution services.

#### (c) Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated to the President $50,000,000 each for fiscal year 1985 and fiscal year 1986 to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, to remain available until expanded.

#### (d) Authority of President
* The President may make loans, advances, and grants to, make and perform agreements and contracts with, or enter into transactions with, any individual, corporation, or other body of persons, government or government agency, whether within or without the United States, and international and intergovernmental organizations in furtherance of the purposes and within the limitations of this subchapter.
