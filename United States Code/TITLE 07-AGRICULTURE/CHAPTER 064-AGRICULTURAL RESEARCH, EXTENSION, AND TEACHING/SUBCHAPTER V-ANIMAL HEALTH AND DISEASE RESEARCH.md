### SUBCHAPTER V—ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE RESEARCH

### §3191. Purposes and findings relating to animal health and disease research
#### (a) Purposes
* The purposes of this subchapter are to—

  * (1) promote the general welfare through the improved health and productivity of domestic livestock, poultry, aquatic animals, and other income-producing animals that are essential to the food supply of the United States and the welfare of producers and consumers of animal products;

  * (2) improve the health of horses;

  * (3) facilitate the effective treatment of, and, to the extent possible, prevent animal and poultry diseases in both domesticated and wild animals that, if not controlled, would be disastrous to the United States livestock and poultry industries and endanger the food supply of the United States;

  * (4) improve methods for the control of organisms and residues in food products of animal origin that could endanger the human food supply;

  * (5) improve the housing and management of animals to improve the well-being of livestock production species;

  * (6) minimize livestock and poultry losses due to transportation and handling;

  * (7) protect human health through control of animal diseases transmissible to humans;

  * (8) improve methods of controlling the births of predators and other animals; and

  * (9) otherwise promote the general welfare through expanded programs of research and extension to improve animal health.

#### (b) Findings
* Congress finds that—

  * (1) the total animal health and disease research and extension efforts of State colleges and universities and of the Federal Government would be more effective if there were close coordination between the efforts; and

  * (2) colleges and universities having accredited schools or colleges of veterinary medicine and State agricultural experiment stations that conduct animal health and disease research are especially vital in training research workers in animal health and related disciplines.

The facts and reasons concerning the determination and withholding shall be reported to the President; and the amount involved shall be kept separate in the Treasury until the close of the next Congress. If the next Congress does not direct such sum to be paid, it shall be carried to surplus.

### §3199. Requirements for use of funds
* With respect to research projects on problems of animal health and disease to be performed at eligible institutions and supported with funds allocated to the States under subsection (c) of section 3195 of this title to carry out subsection (a) of such section, the dean or director of each eligible institution shall cause to be prepared and shall review proposals for such research projects, which contain data showing compliance with the purpose in section 3191 of this title and the provisions for use of funds specified in section 3195(a) of this title, and with general guidelines for project eligibility to be provided by the Secretary. Such research proposals that are approved by the dean or director shall be submitted to the Secretary prior to assignment of funds thereto with a brief summary showing compliance with the provisions of this subtitle and the Secretary's general guidelines.

### §3200. Matching funds
* No funds in excess of $100,000, exclusive of the funds provided for research on specific national or regional animal health and disease problems under the provisions of section 3196 of this title, shall be paid by the Federal Government to any State under subsection (c) of section 3195 of this title to carry out subsection (a) of such section during any fiscal year in excess of the amount from non-Federal sources made available to and budgeted for expenditure by eligible institutions in the State during the same fiscal year for animal health and disease research. The Secretary is authorized to make such payments in excess of $100,000 on the certificate of the appropriate official of the eligible institution having charge of the animal health and disease research for which such payments are to be made. If any eligible institution certified for receipt of matching funds fails to make available and budget for expenditure for animal health and disease research in any fiscal year sums at least equal to the amount for which it is certified, the difference between the Federal matching funds available and the funds made available to and budgeted for expenditure by the eligible institution shall be reapportioned by the Secretary among other eligible institutions of the same State, if there are any which qualify therefor, and, if there are none, the Secretary shall reapportion such difference among the other States.

### §3201. Funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to other provisions of law
* The sums appropriated and allocated to States and eligible institutions under subsection (c) of section 3195 of this title to carry out subsection (a) of such section or section 3196 of this title, as applicable, shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, sums appropriated or otherwise made available to such States and institutions pursuant to other provisions of law.
