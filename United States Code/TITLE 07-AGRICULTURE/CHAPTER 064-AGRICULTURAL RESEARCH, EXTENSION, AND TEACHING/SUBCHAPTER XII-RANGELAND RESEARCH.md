### SUBCHAPTER XII—RANGELAND RESEARCH

### §3331. Congressional statement of purpose
* It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the general welfare through improved productivity of the Nation's rangelands, which comprise 60 per centum of the land area of the United States. Most of these rangelands are unsuited for cultivation, but produce a great volume of forage that is inedible by humans but readily converted, through an energy efficient process, to high quality food protein by grazing animals. These native grazing lands are located throughout the United States and are important resources for major segments of the Nation's livestock industry. In addition to the many livestock producers directly dependent on rangelands, other segments of agriculture are indirectly dependent on range-fed livestock and on range-produced forage that can be substituted for grain in times of grain scarcity. Recent resource assessments indicate that forage production of rangeland can be increased at least 100 per centum through development and application of improved range management practices while simultaneously enhancing wildlife, watershed, recreational, and aesthetic values and reducing hazards of erosion and flooding.

### §3332. Program; development, purposes, scope, etc.
* The Secretary may develop and implement a cooperative rangeland research program in coordination with the program carried out under the Renewable Resources Extension Act of 1978 [16 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.], to improve the production and quality of desirable native forages or introduced forages which are managed in a similar manner to native forages for livestock and wildlife. The program shall include studies of: (1) management of rangelands and agricultural land as integrated systems for more efficient utilization of crops and waste products in the production of food and fiber; (2) methods of managing rangeland watersheds to maximize efficient use of water and improve water yield, water quality, and water conservation, to protect against onsite and offsite damage of rangeland resources from floods, erosion, and other detrimental influences, and to remedy unsatisfactory and unstable rangeland conditions; (3) revegetation and rehabilitation of rangelands including the control of undesirable species of plants; and (4) such other matters as the Secretary considers appropriate.

### §3333. Rangeland research grants
#### (a) In general
* The Secretary may make grants to—

  * (1) land-grant colleges and universities, State agricultural experiment stations, and colleges, universities, and Federal laboratories having a demonstrable capacity in rangeland research, as determined by the Secretary, to carry out rangeland research; and

  * (2) the Joe Skeen Institute for Rangeland Restoration for the purposes of facilitating and expanding ongoing State-Federal range management, animal husbandry, and agricultural research, education, and extension programs to meet the targeted, emerging, and future needs of western United States rangelands and associated natural resources.

#### (b) Matching requirements
* #### (1) In general
  * Except as provided in paragraph (2), this grant program shall be based on a matching formula of 50 percent Federal and 50 percent non-Federal funding (including funding from an agricultural commodity promotion, research, and information program).

* #### (2) Exception
  * Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a grant to a Federal laboratory or a grant under subsection (a)(2).

### §3336. Authorization of appropriations; allocation of funds
* (a) There are authorized to be appropriated, to implement the provisions of this subchapter—

  * (1) $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1991 through 2013; and

  * (2) $2,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2023.


* (b) Funds appropriated under this section shall be allocated by the Secretary to eligible institutions for work to be done as mutually agreed upon between the Secretary and the eligible institution or institutions.
