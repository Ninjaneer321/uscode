Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to recommend prosecution, or institution of civil penalty proceedings, libel proceedings, cease-and-desist proceedings, or proceedings for the enforcement of a cease-and-desist order, for minor violations of this chapter or the rules and regulations made and promulgated thereunder whenever he believes that the public interest will be adequately served by suitable written notice or warning.
