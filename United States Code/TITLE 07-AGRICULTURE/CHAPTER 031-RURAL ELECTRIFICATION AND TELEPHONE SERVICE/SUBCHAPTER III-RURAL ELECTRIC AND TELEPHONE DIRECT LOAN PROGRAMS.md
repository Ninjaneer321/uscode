#### (a) Conditions for prepayment
* Except as provided in subsection (c), a borrower of a loan made by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed under section 936 of this title may prepay such loan (or any loan advance thereunder) by paying the outstanding principal balance due on the loan (or advance), if—

  * (2) private capital, with the existing loan guarantee, is used to replace the loan; and

  * (3) the borrower certifies that any savings from such prepayment will be passed on to its customers or used to improve the financial strength of the borrower in cases of financial hardship.

#### (c) Disqualification for prepayment on finding of adverse affect on Federal Financing Bank
* (1) A borrower will not qualify for prepayment under this section if, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prepay in such borrower's case would adversely affect the operation of the Federal Financing Bank.

* (2) Paragraph (1) shall be effective in fiscal year 1987 only for any loan the prepayment of the principal amount of which will cause the cumulative amount of net proceeds from all such prepayments made during such year to exceed $2,017,500,000.

#### (d) Amount of permissible prepayments; establishment of eligibility criteria
* (1) The Secretary shall permit, subject to subsection (a), prepayments of principal on loans in fiscal year 1987 under this section or Public Law 99–349 in such amounts as to realize net proceeds from all such prepayments in fiscal year 1987 in an amount not less than $2,017,500,000.

However, the Secretary may require that any such guarantee, if transfered or assigned, be transferred or assigned to a loan or security that, if sold, will be grouped with nonguaranteed loans or securities and sold in a manner to ensure that such sale will not unreasonably compete with the marketing of obligations of the United States.

    * (B) the present value of the loan discounted from the face value at maturity at the rate established by the Secretary.

* #### (3) Discount rate
  * The discount rate applicable to the prepayment under this subsection of a loan or loan advance shall be the then current cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the loan.

          * (bb) interest on the amount described in item (aa), for the period beginning on the date of the prepayment and ending on the date of the repayment, at a rate equal to the average annual cost of borrowing by the Department of the Treasury.

  * #### (B) Effect on existing agreements
    * If a borrower and the Secretary have entered into an agreement with respect to a prepayment occurring before October 21, 1992, this paragraph shall supersede any provision in the agreement relating to the restoration of eligibility for loans under this chapter.
