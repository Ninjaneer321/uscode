To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall deploy next generation radiation detection technology.

#### (b) Strategy
* The Secretary shall develop a strategy for the deployment of radiation detection capabilities that includes—

  * (1) a risk-based prioritization of ports of entry at which radiation detection equipment will be deployed;

  * (2) a proposed timeline of when radiation detection equipment will be deployed at each port of entry identified under paragraph (1);

  * (3) the type of equipment to be used at each port of entry identified under paragraph (1), including the joint deployment and utilization of radiation detection equipment and nonintrusive imaging equipment;

  * (4) standard operating procedures for examining containers with such equipment, including sensor alarming, networking, and communications and response protocols;

  * (5) operator training plans;

  * (6) an evaluation of the environmental health and safety impacts of nonintrusive imaging technology and a radiation risk reduction plan, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, that seeks to minimize radiation exposure of workers and the public to levels as low as reasonably achievable;

  * (7) the policy of the Department for using nonintrusive imaging equipment in tandem with radiation detection equipment; and

  * (8) a classified annex that—

    * (A) details plans for covert testing; and

    * (B) outlines the risk-based prioritization of ports of entry identified under paragraph (1).

#### (c) Standards
* The Secretary, acting through the Director for Domestic Nuclear Detection and in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall publish technical capability standards and recommended standard operating procedures for the use of nonintrusive imaging and radiation detection equipment in the United States. Such standards and procedures—

  * (1) should take into account relevant standards and procedures utilized by other Federal departments or agencies as well as those developed by international bodies; and

  * (2) shall not be designed so as to endorse specific companies or create sovereignty conflicts with participating countries.

#### (d) Implementation
* Not later than 3 years after October 13, 2006, the Secretary shall fully implement the strategy developed under subsection (b).

#### (e) Expansion to other United States ports of entry
* #### (1) In general
  * As soon as practicable after—

    * (A) implementation of the program for the examination of containers for radiation at ports of entry described in subsection (a); and

    * (B) submission of the strategy developed under subsection (b),


* but not later than December 31, 2008, the Secretary shall expand the strategy developed under subsection (b), in a manner consistent with the requirements of subsection (b), to provide for the deployment of radiation detection capabilities at all other United States ports of entry not covered by the strategy developed under subsection (b).

* #### (2) Risk assessment
  * In expanding the strategy under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall identify and assess the risks to those other ports of entry in order to determine what equipment and practices will best mitigate the risks.

#### (f) Intermodal Rail Radiation Detection Test Center
* #### (1) Establishment
  * In accordance with subsection (b), and in order to comply with this section, the Secretary shall establish an Intermodal Rail Radiation Detection Test Center (referred to in this subsection as the "Test Center").

* #### (2) Projects
  * The Secretary shall conduct multiple, concurrent projects at the Test Center to rapidly identify and test concepts specific to the challenges posed by on-dock rail.

* #### (3) Location
  * The Test Center shall be located within a public port facility at which a majority of the containerized cargo is directly laden from (or unladen to) on-dock, intermodal rail.

### §921a. Integration of detection equipment and technologies
#### (a) Responsibility of Secretary
* The Secretary of Homeland Security shall have responsibility for ensuring that domestic chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear detection equipment and technologies are integrated, as appropriate, with other border security systems and detection technologies.

#### (b) Report
* Not later than 6 months after August 3, 2007, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress that contains a plan to develop a departmental technology assessment process to determine and certify the technology readiness levels of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear detection technologies before the full deployment of such technologies within the United States.

### §923. Random searches of containers
* Not later than 1 year after October 13, 2006, the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, shall develop and implement a plan, utilizing best practices for empirical scientific research design and random sampling, to conduct random searches of containers in addition to any targeted or preshipment inspection of such containers required by law or regulation or conducted under any other program conducted by the Secretary. Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that implementation of the random sampling plan precludes additional searches of containers not inspected pursuant to the plan.

### §924. Threat assessment screening of port truck drivers
* Not later than 90 days after October 13, 2006, the Secretary shall implement a threat assessment screening, including name-based checks against terrorist watch lists and immigration status check, for all port truck drivers with access to secure areas of a port who have a commercial driver's license but do not have a current and valid hazardous materials endorsement issued in accordance with section 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, that is the same as the threat assessment screening required for facility employees and longshoremen by the Commandant of the Coast Guard under Coast Guard Notice USCG–2006–24189 (Federal Register, Vol. 71, No. 82, Friday, April 28, 2006).

### §925. Border Patrol unit for United States Virgin Islands
#### (a) In general
* The Secretary may establish at least 1 Border Patrol unit for the United States Virgin Islands.

#### (b) Report
* Not later than 180 days after October 13, 2006, the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees that includes the schedule, if any, for carrying out subsection (a).

### §926. Center of Excellence for Maritime Domain Awareness
#### (a) Establishment
* The Secretary shall establish a university-based Center for Excellence for Maritime Domain Awareness following the merit-review processes and procedures that have been established by the Secretary for selecting university program centers of excellence.

#### (b) Duties
* The Center established under subsection (a) shall—

  * (1) prioritize its activities based on the "National Plan To Improve Maritime Domain Awareness" published by the Department in October 2005;

  * (2) recognize the extensive previous and ongoing work and existing competence in the field of maritime domain awareness at numerous academic and research institutions, such as the Naval Postgraduate School;

  * (3) leverage existing knowledge and continue development of a broad base of expertise within academia and industry in maritime domain awareness; and

  * (4) provide educational, technical, and analytical assistance to Federal agencies with responsibilities for maritime domain awareness, including the Coast Guard, to focus on the need for interoperability, information sharing, and common information technology standards and architecture.
