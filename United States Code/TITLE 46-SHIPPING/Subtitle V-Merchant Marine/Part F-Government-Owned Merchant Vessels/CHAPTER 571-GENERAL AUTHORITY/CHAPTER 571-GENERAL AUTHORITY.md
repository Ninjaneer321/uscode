  * (6) for civil contingency operations and Maritime Administration promotional and media events, in accordance with subsection (f).

    * (C) maintain and adequately crew, as necessary, in an enhanced readiness status those vessels that are scheduled to be activated in 5 or less days;

    * (D) locate those vessels that are scheduled to be activated near embarkation ports specified for those vessels; and

    * (E) notwithstanding section 2109 of title 46, United States Code, have each vessel inspected by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to determine if the vessel meets the safety standards that would apply under part B of subtitle II of that title if the vessel were not a public vessel.


  * (2) VESSEL MANAGERS.—

    * (A) ELIGIBILITY FOR CONTRACT.—A person, including a shipyard, is eligible for a contract for the management of a vessel in the Ready Reserve Force if the Secretary determines, at a minimum, that the person has—

      * (ii) the management capability necessary to operate, maintain, and activate the vessel at a reasonable price.


    * (B) CONTRACT REQUIREMENT.—The Secretary of Transportation shall include in each contract for the management of a vessel in the Ready Reserve Force a requirement that each seaman who performs services on any vessel covered by the contract hold the license or merchant mariner's document that would be required under chapter 71 or chapter 73 of title 46, United States Code, for a seaman performing that service while operating the vessel if the vessel were not a public vessel.


* (d) APPLICABILITY OF LIMITATIONS ON OVERHAUL, REPAIR, AND MAINTENANCE IN FOREIGN SHIPYARDS.—

  * (1) APPLICATION OF LIMITATION.—The provisions of section 8680 of title 10 shall apply to vessels specified in subsection (b), and to the Secretary of Transportation with respect to those vessels, in the same manner as those provisions apply to vessels specified in subsection (b) of such section, and to the Secretary of the Navy, respectively.

The Secretary may receive and retain reimbursement from such entities for all costs incurred related to the provision of such services.

  * (2) AMOUNTS RECEIVED.—Amounts received as reimbursements under this subsection shall be credited to the fund or account that was used to cover the costs incurred by the Secretary or, if the period of availability of obligations for that appropriation has expired, to the appropriation of funds that is currently available to the Secretary for substantially the same purpose.

### §57111. Salvage recoveries for subrogated ownership of vessels and cargoes
