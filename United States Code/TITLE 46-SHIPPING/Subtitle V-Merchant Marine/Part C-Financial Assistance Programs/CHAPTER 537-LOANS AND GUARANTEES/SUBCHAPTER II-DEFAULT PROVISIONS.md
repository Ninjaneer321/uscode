* (a) CASH PAYMENT.—Amounts required to be paid by the Secretary or Administrator under section 53721 or 53722 of this title shall be paid in cash.

The Secretary or Administrator, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prescribe the form, denomination, maturity, and other terms (except the interest rate) of the obligations.

The purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include the purchase of obligations under this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury may sell obligations purchased under this section. A redemption, purchase, or sale of the obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury is a public debt transaction of the Government.
