  * (3) CONTRACT FOR QUALIFIED WITHDRAWAL.—Under paragraph (1), an amount shall not be treated as remaining in a capital construction fund at the close of a taxable year to the extent there is a binding contract at the close of the taxable year for a qualified withdrawal of the amount for an identified item for which the withdrawal may be made.
