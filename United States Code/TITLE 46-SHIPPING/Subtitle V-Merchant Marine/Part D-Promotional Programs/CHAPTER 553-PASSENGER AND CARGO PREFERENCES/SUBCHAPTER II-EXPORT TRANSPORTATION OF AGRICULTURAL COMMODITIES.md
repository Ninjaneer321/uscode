### SUBCHAPTER II—EXPORT TRANSPORTATION OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES

### §55311. Findings and purposes
* (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—

  * (1) a productive and healthy agricultural industry and a strong and active United States maritime industry are vitally important to the economic well-being and security of the United States;

  * (2) both industries must compete in international markets increasingly dominated by foreign trade barriers and the subsidization practices of foreign governments; and

  * (3) increased agricultural exports and the use of merchant vessels of the United States contribute positively to the United States balance of trade and generate employment opportunities in the United States.


* (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this subchapter are to—

  * (1) enable the Secretary of Agriculture to plan export programs effectively, by clarifying the ocean transportation requirements applicable to those programs;

  * (2) take immediate and positive steps to promote the growth of the cargo-carrying capacity of the United States merchant marine;

  * (3) expand international trade in United States agricultural commodities and products and develop, maintain, and expand markets for United States agricultural exports;

  * (4) improve the efficiency of administration of both the commodity purchasing and selling activities and the ocean transportation activities associated with export programs sponsored by the Secretary;

  * (5) stimulate and promote the agricultural and maritime industries of the United States and encourage cooperative efforts by both industries to address their common problems; and

  * (6) provide for the appropriate disposition of these findings and purposes.
