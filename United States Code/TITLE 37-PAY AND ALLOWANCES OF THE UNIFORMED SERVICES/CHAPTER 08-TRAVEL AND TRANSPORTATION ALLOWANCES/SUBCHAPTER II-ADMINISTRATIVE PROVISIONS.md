### SUBCHAPTER II—ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

### §461. Relationship to other travel and transportation authorities
* An authorized traveler may not be paid travel and transportation allowances or receive travel-in-kind and transportation-in-kind, or a combination thereof, under both subchapter I and subchapter III for official travel performed under a single or related travel and transportation order or authorization by the administering Secretary.

### §462. Travel and transportation allowances paid to members that are unauthorized or in excess of authorized amounts: requirement for repayment
* (a) REPAYMENT REQUIRED.—Except as provided in subsection (b), a member of the uniformed services or other person who is paid travel and transportation allowances under subchapter I shall repay to the United States any amount of such payment that is determined to be unauthorized or in excess of the applicable authorized amount.

* (b) EXCEPTION.—The regulations prescribed under section 464 of this title shall specify procedures for determining the circumstances under which an exception to repayment otherwise required by subsection (a) may be granted.

* (c) EFFECT OF BANKRUPTCY.—An obligation to repay the United States under this section is, for all purposes, a debt owed the United States. A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 does not discharge a person from such debt if the discharge order is entered less than five years after the date on which the debt was incurred.

* (a) PROGRAMS OF COMPLIANCE.—The administering Secretaries shall provide for compliance with the requirements of this chapter through programs of compliance established and maintained for that purpose.

* (b) ELEMENTS.—The programs of compliance under subsection (a) shall—

  * (1) minimize the provision of benefits under this chapter based on inaccurate claims, unauthorized claims, overstated or inflated claims, and multiple claims for the same benefits through the electronic verification of travel claims on a near-time basis and such other means as the administering Secretaries may establish for purposes of the programs of compliance; and

  * (2) ensure that benefits provided under this chapter do not exceed reasonable or actual and necessary expenses of travel claimed or reasonable allowances based on commercial travel rates.


* (c) ELECTRONIC PROCESSING OF TRAVEL CLAIMS.—(1) By not later than the date that is five years after the date of the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, any travel claim under this chapter shall be processed electronically.

* (2) The administering Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, may waive the requirement in paragraph (1) with respect to a particular claim in the interests of the department concerned.

* (3) The electronic processing of claims under this subsection shall be subject to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense under section 464 of this title which shall apply uniformly to all members of the uniformed services and, to the extent practicable, to all other authorized travelers.

### §464. Regulations
* This subchapter and subchapter I shall be administered under terms, rates, conditions, and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the other administering Secretaries for members of the uniformed services. Such regulations shall be uniform for the Department of Defense and shall apply as uniformly as practicable to the uniformed services under the jurisdiction of the other administering Secretaries.
