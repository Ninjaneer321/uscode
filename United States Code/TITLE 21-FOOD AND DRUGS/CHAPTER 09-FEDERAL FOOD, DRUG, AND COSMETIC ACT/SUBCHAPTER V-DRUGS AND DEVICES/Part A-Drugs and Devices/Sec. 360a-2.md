### §360a–2. Susceptibility test interpretive criteria for microorganisms
#### (a) Purpose; identification of criteria
* #### (1) Purpose
  * The purpose of this section is to clarify the Secretary's authority to—

    * (A) efficiently update susceptibility test interpretive criteria for antimicrobial drugs when necessary for public health, due to, among other things, the constant evolution of microorganisms that leads to the development of resistance to drugs that have been effective in decreasing morbidity and mortality for patients, which warrants unique management of antimicrobial drugs that is inappropriate for most other drugs in order to delay or prevent the development of further resistance to existing therapies;

    * (B) provide for public notice of the availability of recognized interpretive criteria and interpretive criteria standards; and

    * (C) clear under section 360(k) of this title, classify under section 360c(f)(2) of this title, or approve under section 360e of this title, antimicrobial susceptibility testing devices utilizing updated, recognized susceptibility test interpretive criteria to characterize the in vitro susceptibility of particular bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms, as applicable, to antimicrobial drugs.

* #### (2) Identification of criteria
  * The Secretary shall identify appropriate susceptibility test interpretive criteria with respect to antimicrobial drugs—

    * (A) if such criteria are available on the date of approval of the drug under section 355 of this title or licensure of the drug under section 262 of title 42 (as applicable), upon such approval or licensure; or

    * (B) if such criteria are unavailable on such date, on the date on which such criteria are available for such drug.

* #### (3) Bases for initial identification
  * The Secretary shall identify appropriate susceptibility test interpretive criteria under paragraph (2), based on the Secretary's review of, to the extent available and relevant—

    * (A) preclinical and clinical data, including pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and epidemiological data;

    * (B) the relationship of susceptibility test interpretive criteria to morbidity and mortality associated with the disease or condition for which such drug is used; and

    * (C) such other evidence and information as the Secretary considers appropriate.

#### (b) Susceptibility test Interpretive Criteria Website
* #### (1) In general
  * Not later than 1 year after December 13, 2016, the Secretary shall establish, and maintain thereafter, on the website of the Food and Drug Administration, a dedicated website that contains a list of any appropriate new or updated susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards and interpretive criteria in accordance with paragraph (2) (referred to in this section as the "Interpretive Criteria Website").

* #### (2) Listing of susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards and interpretive criteria
  * #### (A) In general
    * The list described in paragraph (1) shall consist of any new or updated susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards that are—

      * (i) established by a nationally or internationally recognized standard development organization that—

        * (I) establishes and maintains procedures to address potential conflicts of interest and ensure transparent decisionmaking;

        * (II) holds open meetings to ensure that there is an opportunity for public input by interested parties, and establishes and maintains processes to ensure that such input is considered in decisionmaking; and

        * (III) permits its standards to be made publicly available, through the National Library of Medicine or another similar source acceptable to the Secretary; and


      * (ii) recognized in whole, or in part, by the Secretary under subsection (c).

  * #### (B) Other list
    * The Interpretive Criteria Website shall, in addition to the list described in subparagraph (A), include a list of interpretive criteria, if any, that the Secretary has determined to be appropriate with respect to legally marketed antimicrobial drugs, where—

      * (i) the Secretary does not recognize, in whole or in part, an interpretive criteria standard described under subparagraph (A) otherwise applicable to such a drug;

      * (ii) the Secretary withdraws under subsection (c)(1)(A) recognition of a standard, in whole or in part, otherwise applicable to such a drug;

      * (iii) the Secretary approves an application under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42, as applicable, with respect to marketing of such a drug for which there are no relevant interpretive criteria included in a standard recognized by the Secretary under subsection (c); or

      * (iv) because the characteristics of such a drug differ from other drugs with the same active ingredient, the interpretive criteria with respect to such drug—

        * (I) differ from otherwise applicable interpretive criteria included in a standard listed under subparagraph (A) or interpretive criteria otherwise listed under this subparagraph; and

        * (II) are determined by the Secretary to be appropriate for the drug.
