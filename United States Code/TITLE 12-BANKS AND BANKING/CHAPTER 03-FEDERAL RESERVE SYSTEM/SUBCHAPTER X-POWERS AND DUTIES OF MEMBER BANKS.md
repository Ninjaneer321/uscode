No executive officer of any member bank may become indebted to that member bank except by means of an extension of credit which the bank is authorized to make under this section. Any extension of credit under this section shall be promptly reported to the board of directors of the bank, and may be made only if—

  * (B) it is on terms not more favorable than those afforded other borrowers;

  * (C) the officer has submitted a detailed current financial statement; and

  * (D) it is on condition that it shall become due and payable on demand of the bank at any time when the officer is indebted to any other bank or banks on account of extensions of credit of any one of the three categories respectively referred to in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) in an aggregate amount greater than the amount of credit of the same category that could be extended to him by the bank of which he is an officer.

* A member bank may make a loan to any executive officer of the bank if, at the time the loan is made—

  * (A) it is secured by a first lien on a dwelling which is expected, after the making of the loan, to be owned by the officer and used by him as his residence, and

* Except to the extent permitted under paragraph (4), a member bank may not extend credit to a partnership in which one or more of its executive officers are partners having either individually or together a majority interest. For the purposes of paragraph (4), the full amount of any credit so extended shall be considered to have been extended to each officer of the bank who is a member of the partnership.

#### (6) Endorsement or guarantee of loans or assets; protective indebtedness
* This section does not prohibit any executive officer of a member bank from endorsing or guaranteeing for the protection of the bank any loan or other asset previously acquired by the bank in good faith or from incurring any indebtedness to the bank for the purpose of protecting the bank against loss or giving financial assistance to it.

#### (7) Continuation of violation
* Each day that any extension of credit in violation of this section exists is a continuation of the violation for the purposes of section 1818 of this title.

#### (8) Rules and regulations; definitions
* The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may prescribe such rules and regulations, including definitions of terms, as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes and to prevent evasions of this section.

* #### (A) In general
  * A member bank may extend credit to its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders, or to any related interest of such a person, only if the extension of credit—

    * (ii) does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and

    * (iii) the bank follows credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those applicable to comparable transactions by the bank with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, or employees of the bank.

* #### (B) Exception
  * Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any extension of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program—

    * (i) that is widely available to employees of the member bank; and

#### (3) Prior approval required
* A member bank may extend credit to a person described in paragraph (1) in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other outstanding extensions of credit by that bank to each such person and that person's related interests, would exceed an amount prescribed by regulation of the appropriate Federal banking agency (as defined in section 1813 of this title) only if—

For purposes of this paragraph, section 84 of this title shall be deemed to apply to a State member bank as if the State member bank were a national banking association.

#### (5) Aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders
* #### (A) In general
  * A member bank may extend credit to any executive officer, director, or principal shareholder, or to any related interest of such a person, if the extension of credit is in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all outstanding extensions of credit by that bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and those persons' related interests would not exceed the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.

* #### (B) More stringent limit authorized
  * The Board may, by regulation, prescribe a limit that is more stringent than that contained in subparagraph (A).

* #### (C) Board may make exceptions for certain banks
  * The Board may, by regulation, make exceptions to subparagraph (A) for member banks with less than $100,000,000 in deposits if the Board determines that the exceptions are important to avoid constricting the availability of credit in small communities or to attract directors to such banks. In no case may the aggregate amount of all outstanding extensions of credit to a bank's executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and those persons' related interests be more than 2 times the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.

#### (6) Overdrafts by executive officers and directors prohibited

* #### (B) Exception
  * The Board may, by regulation, make exceptions to subparagraph (A) for any executive officer or director of a subsidiary of a company that controls the member bank if—

    * (i) the executive officer or director does not have authority to participate, and does not participate, in major policymaking functions of the member bank; and
