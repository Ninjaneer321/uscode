### §1782. Administration of insurance fund
#### (a) Reports of condition
* (1) Each insured credit union shall make reports of condition to the Board upon dates which shall be selected by it. Such reports of condition shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Board may require. The reporting dates selected for reports of condition shall be the same for all insured credit unions except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any credit union the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. The total amount of the member accounts of each insured credit union as of each reporting date shall be reported in such reports of condition in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board. Each report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, by a vice president, by the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors of the reporting credit union to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of such officer's knowledge and belief. Unless such requirement is waived by the Board, the correctness of each report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of three of the officers of the reporting credit union with the declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct.

* (2) The Board may call for such other reports as it may from time to time require.

* (3) The Board may require reports of condition to be published in such manner, not inconsistent with any applicable law, as it may direct. Any insured credit union which maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, or inadvertently transmits or publishes any report which is minimally late, shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $2,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. The insured credit union shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent and that a report was inadvertently transmitted or published late. Any insured credit union which fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, in a manner not described in the 2nd preceding sentence shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $20,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any insured credit union knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any information or report described in such sentence submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, the Board may assess a penalty of not more than $1,000,000 or 1 percent of total assets of such credit union, whichever is less, per day for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Any penalty imposed under any of the 4 preceding sentences shall be assessed and collected by the Board in the manner provided in section 1786(k)(2) of this title (for penalties imposed under such section) and any such assessment (including the determination of the amount of the penalty) shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Any insured credit union against which any penalty is assessed under this subsection shall be afforded an agency hearing if such insured credit union submits a request for such hearing within 20 days after the issuance of the notice of assessment. Section 1786(j) of this title shall apply to any proceeding under this subsection.

* (4) The Board may accept any report of condition made to any commission, board, or authority having supervision of a State-chartered credit union and may furnish to any such commission, board, or authority reports of condition made to the Board.

* (5) Reports required under subchapter I of this chapter shall be so prepared that they can be used for share insurance purposes. To the maximum extent feasible, the Board shall use for insurance purposes reports submitted to State regulatory agencies by State-chartered credit unions.

* (6) AUDIT REQUIREMENT.—

  * (A) IN GENERAL.—Before the end of the 120-day period beginning on August 9, 1989, and notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, the Board shall prescribe, by regulation, audit standards which require an outside, independent audit of any insured credit union by a certified public accountant for any fiscal year (of such credit union)—

    * (i) for which such credit union has not conducted an annual supervisory committee audit;

    * (ii) for which such credit union has not received a complete and satisfactory supervisory committee audit; or

    * (iii) during which such credit union has experienced persistent and serious recordkeeping deficiencies, as determined by the Board.


  * (B) UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE.—The Board may treat the failure of any insured credit union to obtain an outside, independent audit for any fiscal year for which such audit is required under subparagraph (A) or (D) as an unsafe or unsound practice within the meaning of section 1786(b) of this title.

    * (i) IN GENERAL.—Accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with the Board by each insured credit union shall be uniform and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

    * (i) IN GENERAL.—Each insured credit union having total assets of $500,000,000 or more shall have an annual independent audit of the financial statements of the credit union, performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an independent certified public accountant or public accountant licensed by the appropriate State or jurisdiction to perform those services.

    * (ii) VOLUNTARY AUDITS.—If a Federal credit union that is not required to conduct an audit under clause (i), and that has total assets of more than $10,000,000 conducts such an audit for any purpose, using an independent auditor who is compensated for his or her audit services with respect to that audit, the audit shall be performed consistent with the accountancy laws of the appropriate State or jurisdiction, including licensing requirements.


* (7) REPORT TO INDEPENDENT AUDITOR.—

  * (A) IN GENERAL.—Each insured credit union which has engaged the services of an independent auditor to audit such depository institution within the past 2 years shall transmit to such auditor a copy of the most recent report of condition made by such credit union (pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law) and a copy of the most recent report of examination received by such credit union.

  * (B) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.—In addition to the copies of the reports required to be provided to an auditor under subparagraph (A), each insured credit union shall provide such auditor with—

    * (i) a copy of any supervisory memorandum of understanding with such credit union and any written agreement between the Board or a State regulatory agency and the credit union which is in effect during the period covered by the audit; and

    * (ii) a report of any action initiated or taken by the Board during such period under subsection (e), (f), (g), (i), (l), or (q) of section 1786 of this title, or any similar action taken by a State regulatory agency under State law, or any other civil money penalty assessed by the Board under this chapter, with respect to—

      * (I) the credit union; or

      * (II) any institution-affiliated party.


* (8) DATA SHARING WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND PERSONS.—In addition to reports of examination, reports of condition, and other reports required to be regularly provided to the Board (with respect to all insured credit unions, including a credit union for which the Corporation has been appointed conservator or liquidating agent) or an appropriate State commission, board, or authority having supervision of a State-chartered credit union, the Board may, in the discretion of the Board, furnish any report of examination or other confidential supervisory information concerning any credit union or other entity examined by the Board under authority of any Federal law, to—

  * (A) any other Federal or State agency or authority with supervisory or regulatory authority over the credit union or other entity;

    * (iii) TRANSPARENCY.—Not more than 30 days after the Board establishes and implements a restoration plan under clause (i), the Board shall publish in the Federal Register a detailed analysis of the factors considered and the basis for the actions taken with regard to the plan.

Any such suit may be brought in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district or territory in which the principal office of the credit union is located.

* (2) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO MAKE ACCURATE CERTIFIED STATEMENT OR TO PAY DEPOSIT OR PREMIUM.—

  * (A) FIRST TIER.—Any insured credit union which—

    * (i) maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to submit any certified statement under subsection (b)(1) within the period of time required or submits a false or misleading certified statement under such subsection; or

    * (ii) submits the statement at a time which is minimally after the time required,


* shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $2,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false and misleading information is not corrected. The insured credit union shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent or that a statement was inadvertently submitted late.

  * (B) SECOND TIER.—Any insured credit union which—

    * (i) fails to submit any certified statement under subsection (b)(1) within the period of time required or submits a false or misleading certified statement in a manner not described in subparagraph (A); or

  * (E) HEARING.—Any insured credit union against which any penalty is assessed under this paragraph shall be afforded an agency hearing if the credit union submits a request for such hearing within 20 days after the issuance of the notice of the assessment. Section 1786(j) of this title shall apply to any proceeding under this subparagraph.

  * (F) SPECIAL RULE FOR DISPUTED PAYMENTS.—No penalty may be assessed for the failure of any insured credit union to pay any deposit or premium for insurance if—

    * (i) the failure is due to a dispute between the credit union and the Board over the amount of the deposit or premium which is due from the credit union; and

    * (ii) the credit union deposits security satisfactory to the Board for payment of the deposit or insurance premium upon final determination of the dispute.


* (3) No insured credit union shall pay any dividends on its insured shares or distribute any of its assets while it remains in default in the payment of its deposit or any premium charge for insurance due to the fund. Any director or officer of any insured credit union who knowingly participates in the declaration or payment of any such dividend or in any such distribution shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable in any case in which the default is due to a dispute between the credit union and the Board over the amount of its deposit or the premium charge due to the fund if the credit union deposits security satisfactory to the Board for payment of its deposit or the premium charge upon final determination of the issue.

#### (e) Recovery of unpaid deposit or premium; limitations
* The Board, in a suit brought at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be entitled to recover from any insured credit union the amount of any unpaid deposit or premium charge for insurance lawfully payable by the credit union to the fund, whether or not such credit union shall have made any report of condition under subsection (a) of this section or filed any certified statement required under subsection (b) of this section and whether or not suit shall have been brought to compel the credit union to make any such report or to file any such statement. No action or proceeding shall be brought for the recovery of any deposit or premium charge due to the fund, or for the recovery of any amount paid to the fund in excess of the amount due it, unless such action or proceeding shall have been brought within five years after the right accrued for which the claim is made. Where the insured credit union has made or filed with the Board a false or fraudulent certified statement with the intent to evade, in whole or in part, the payment of its deposit or any premium charge, the claim shall not be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the Board of the fact that the certified statement is false or fraudulent.

#### (f) Penalty for failure to comply with section; court determination of failure; remedies not exclusive
* Should any Federal credit union fail to make any report of condition under subsection (a) of this section or to file any certified statement required to be filed under subsection (b) of this section or to pay its deposit or any premium charge for insurance required to be paid under any provision of this subchapter, and should the credit union fail to correct such failure within thirty days after written notice has been given by the Board to an officer of the credit union, citing this subsection and stating that the credit union has failed to make any such report or file any such statement or pay any such deposit or premium charges as required by law, all the rights, privileges, and franchises of the credit union granted to it under subchapter I of this chapter shall be thereby forfeited. Whether or not the penalty provided in this subsection has been incurred shall be determined and adjudged by any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in a suit brought for that purpose in the district or territory in which the principal office of such credit union is located, under direction of and by the Board in its own name, before the credit union shall be declared dissolved. The remedies provided in this subsection and in subsections (d) and (e) of this section shall not be construed as limiting any other remedies against any insured credit union but shall be in addition thereto.

#### (g) Records
* Each insured credit union shall maintain such records as will readily permit verification of the correctness of its reports of condition, certified statements, and deposit and premium charges for insurance. However, no insured credit union shall be required to retain such records for such purpose for a period in excess of five years from the date of the making of any such report, the filing of any such statement, or the payment of any deposit or adjustment thereof or any premium charge, except that when there is a dispute between the insured credit union and the Board over the amount of any deposit or adjustment thereof or any premium charge for insurance the credit union shall retain such records until final determination of the issue.

Each examiner shall have power to make a thorough examination of all of the affairs of the credit union and shall make a full and detailed report of the condition of the credit union to the Board. The Board in like manner shall appoint claim agents who shall have power to investigate and examine all claims for insured member accounts. Each claim agent shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to examine and to take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter in respect to claims for insured accounts, and to issue subpenas and subpenas duces tecum and, for the enforcement thereof, to apply to the United States district court for the judicial district or the United States court in any territory in which the principal office of the credit union is located or in which the witness resides or carries on business. Such courts shall have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance with any such subpena.

#### (b) Power of Board; jurisdiction of court
* In connection with examinations of insured credit unions, or with other types of investigations to determine compliance with applicable law and regulations, the Board, or its designated representatives, shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to examine and to take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter in respect of the affairs of any such credit union, and to issue subpenas and subpenas duces tecum and to exercise such other powers as are set forth in section 1786(p) of this title and, for the enforcement thereof, to apply to the United States district court for the judicial district or the United States Court in any territory in which the principal office of the credit union is located or in which the witness resides or carries on business.

Such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Board, or before a person designated by it, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or carries on business or wherever he may be found. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, or other papers in obedience to a subpena issued under the authority of this subchapter on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to penalty or forfeiture, but no individual shall be prosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.

* (1) If the applicable rate prescribed in this subsection exceeds the rate an insured credit union would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection, such credit union may, notwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this subsection, take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan, interest at a rate of not more than 1 per centum in excess of the discount rate on ninety-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal Reserve bank in the Federal Reserve district where such insured credit union is located or at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, territory, or district where such credit union is located, whichever may be greater.

* #### (1) In general
  * The submission by any person of any information to the Administration, any State credit union supervisor, or foreign banking authority for any purpose in the course of any supervisory or regulatory process of such Board, supervisor, or authority shall not be construed as waiving, destroying, or otherwise affecting any privilege such person may claim with respect to such information under Federal or State law as to any person or entity other than such Board, supervisor, or authority.

* #### (2) Rule of construction
  * No provision of paragraph (1) may be construed as implying or establishing that—

### §1786. Termination of insured credit union status; cease and desist orders; removal or suspension from office; procedure
#### (a) Termination of insurance
* (1) Any insured credit union other than a Federal credit union may, upon not less than ninety days' written notice to the Board and upon the affirmative vote of a majority of its members within one year prior to the giving of such notice, terminate its status as an insured credit union.

* (2) Any insured credit union, other than a Federal credit union, which has obtained a new certificate of insurance from a corporation authorized and duly licensed to insure member accounts may upon not less than ninety days' written notice to the Board convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter: _Provided_, That at the time of giving notice to the Board the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not being invoked against the credit union.

#### (b) Unsound condition of credit union; notice to correct condition; hearing; judicial review
* (1) Whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union is engaging or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of such credit union, or is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured credit union, or is violating or has violated an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request by the credit union or institution-affiliated party,, or is violating or has violated any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board shall serve upon the credit union a statement with respect to such practices or conditions or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof. In the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board shall send a copy of such statement to the commission, board, or authority, if any, having supervision of such credit union. Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty days after service of such statement, or within such shorter period of not less than twenty days after such service as the Board shall require in any case where it determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union could be unduly jeopardized by further delay in the correction of such practices or conditions or violations, or as the commission, board, or authority having supervision of such credit union, if any, shall require in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the credit union not less than thirty days' written notice of its intention to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured credit union. Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe and unsound practices or conditions or violations and shall fix a time and place for a hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of the credit union. Unless the credit union shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured credit union. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or violation specified in the notice has been established and has not been corrected within the time above-prescribed in which to make such correction, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union an order terminating its status as an insured credit union on a date subsequent to the date of such finding and subsequent to the expiration of the time specified in the notice.

* (2) Any credit union whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (j) of this section.

#### (c) Notice to members of termination of insured status
* In the event of the termination of a credit union's status as an insured credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the credit union shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its members whose accounts are insured that it has ceased to be an insured credit union. It may include in such notice a statement of the fact that member accounts insured on the effective date of such termination, to the extent not withdrawn, remain insured for one year from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured credit union. In the event of failure to give the notice as herein provided to members whose accounts are insured, the Board is authorized to give reasonable notice.

#### (d) Continuation of insurance for one year; approval of conversion of status; procedure subsequent to approval; reduction of premium charges
* (1) After the termination of the insured status of any credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, insurance of its member accounts to the extent that they were insured on the effective date of such termination, less any amounts thereafter withdrawn which reduce the accounts below the amount covered by insurance on the effective date of such termination, shall continue for a period of one year, but no shares issued by the credit union or deposits made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Board. The credit union shall continue to maintain its deposit with and pay premiums to the Board during such period as in the case of an insured credit union and the Board shall have the right to examine such credit union from time to time during the period during which such insurance continues. Such credit union shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured credit union for the period of one year from the date of such termination. In the event that such credit union shall be closed for liquidation within such period of one year, the Board shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such credit union as in the case of an insured credit union. Notwithstanding the above, when an insured credit union's insured status is terminated and the credit union subsequently obtains comparable insurance coverage from another source, insurance of its accounts by the fund may cease immediately upon the effective date of such comparable coverage by mutual consent of the credit union and the Board.

* (2) No credit union shall convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section until the proposition for such conversion has been approved by a majority of all the directors of the credit union, and by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who vote on the proposition in a vote in which at least 20 per centum of the total membership of the credit union participates. Following approval by the directors, written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the membership vote shall be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the records of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. The membership shall be given the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. If the proposition is approved by the membership, prompt and reasonable notice of insurance conversion shall be given to all members.

* (3) In the event of a conversion of a credit union from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section, premium charges payable under section 1782(c) of this title shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the number of calendar months for which the converting credit union will no longer be insured under this chapter. As long as a converting credit union remains insured under this chapter, it shall remain subject to all of the provisions of this subchapter.

#### (e) Opinion of Board as to unsound condition of credit union; notice of charges; hearing; order to cease and desist; judicial review
* (1) If, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union, credit union which has insured accounts, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such credit union, or is violating or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the credit union or any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the credit union or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Board shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the credit union or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.

* (2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the credit union or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.

* (3) AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO CORRECT CONDITIONS RESULTING FROM VIOLATIONS OR PRACTICES.—The authority to issue an order under this subsection and subsection (f) which requires an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party to take affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice with respect to which such order is issued includes the authority to require such insured credit union or such party to—

  * (A) make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss if—

    * (i) such credit union or such party was unjustly enriched in connection with such violation or practice; or

    * (ii) the violation or practice involved a reckless disregard for the law or any applicable regulations or prior order of the Board;


  * (B) restrict the growth of the institution;

  * (C) rescind agreements or contracts;

  * (D) dispose of any loan or asset involved;

  * (E) employ qualified officers or employees (who may be subject to approval by the Board at the direction of such Board); and

  * (F) take such other action as the Board determines to be appropriate.


* (4) AUTHORITY TO LIMIT ACTIVITIES.—The authority to issue an order under this subsection or subsection (f) includes the authority to place limitations on the activities or functions of an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party.

#### (f) Temporary cease and desist order; injunctive procedure
* (1) Whenever the Board shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the credit union or any institution-affiliated party pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of the credit union, or is likely to weaken the condition of the credit union or otherwise prejudice the interests of its insured members prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, the Board may issue a temporary order requiring the credit union or such party to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (e)(3). Such order shall become effective upon service upon the credit union or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the credit union or such party, until the effective date of such order.

  * (B) PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO NOTICE.—

Within sixty days of such hearing, the Board shall notify such party whether the suspension or prohibition from participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union will be continued, terminated or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union will be rescinded or otherwise modified. Such notification shall contain a statement of the basis for the Board's decision, if adverse to such party. The Board is authorized to prescribe such rules as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Board, and thereupon the Board shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall, except as provided in the last sentence of said paragraph (1), be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Board.

### §1790e. Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund
#### (a) Establishment of Stabilization Fund
* There is hereby created in the Treasury of the United States a fund to be known as the "Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund." The Board will administer the Stabilization Fund as prescribed by section 1789 of this title.

#### (b) Expenditures from Stabilization Fund
* Money in the Stabilization Fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, without fiscal year limitation, for making payments for the purposes described in section 1783(a) of this title, subject to the following additional limitations:

  * (1) All payments other than administrative payments shall be connected to the conservatorship, liquidation, or threatened conservatorship or liquidation, of a corporate credit union.

  * (2) Prior to authorizing each payment the Board shall—

    * (A) certify that, absent the existence of the Stabilization Fund, the Board would have made the identical payment out of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund); and

    * (B) report each such certification to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.

#### (c) Authority to borrow
* #### (1) In general
  * The Stabilization Fund is authorized to borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury from time-to-time as deemed necessary by the Board. The maximum outstanding amount of all borrowings from the Treasury by the Stabilization Fund and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, combined, is limited to the amount provided for in section 1783(d)(1) of this title, including any authorized increases in that amount.

* #### (2) Repayment of advances
  * #### (A) In general
    * The advances made under this section shall be repaid by the Stabilization Fund, and interest on such advance shall be paid, to the General fund of the Treasury.

  * #### (B) Variable rate of interest
    * The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the first rate determination at the time of the first advance under this section and shall reset the rate again for all advances on each anniversary of the first advance. The interest rate shall be equal to the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity equal to 12 months.

* #### (3) Repayment schedule
  * The Stabilization Fund shall repay the advances on a first-in, first-out basis, with interest on the amount repaid, at times and dates determined by the Board at its discretion. All advances shall be repaid not later than the date of the seventh anniversary of the first advance to the Stabilization Fund, unless the Board extends this final repayment date. The Board shall obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury on any proposed extension, including the terms and conditions of the extended repayment and any additional advances.

#### (d) Assessment authority
* #### (1) Assessments relating to expenditures under subsection (b)
  * In order to make expenditures, as described in subsection (b), the Board may assess a special premium with respect to each insured credit union in an aggregate amount that is reasonably calculated to make any pending or future expenditure described in subsection (b), which premium shall be due and payable not later than 60 days after the date of the assessment. In setting the amount of any assessment under this subsection, the Board shall take into consideration any potential impact on credit union earnings that such an assessment may have.

* #### (2) Special premiums relating to repayments under subsection (c)(3)
  * Not later than 90 days before the scheduled date of each repayment described in subsection (c)(3), the Board shall set the amount of the upcoming repayment and shall determine whether the Stabilization Fund will have sufficient funds to make the repayment. If the Stabilization Fund is not likely to have sufficient funds to make the repayment, the Board shall assess with respect to each insured credit union a special premium, which shall be due and payable not later than 60 days after the date of the assessment, in an aggregate amount calculated to ensure that the Stabilization Fund is able to make the required repayment.

* #### (3) Computation
  * Any assessment or premium charge for an insured credit union under this subsection shall be stated as a percentage of its insured shares, as represented on the previous call report of that insured credit union. The percentage shall be identical for each insured credit union. Any insured credit union that fails to make timely payment of the assessment or special premium is subject to the procedures and penalties described under subsections (d), (e), and (f) of section 1782 of this title.

#### (e) Distributions from Insurance Fund
* At the end of any calendar year in which the Stabilization Fund has an outstanding advance from the Treasury, the Insurance Fund is prohibited from making the distribution to insured credit unions described in section 1782(c)(3) of this title. In lieu of the distribution described in that section, the Insurance Fund shall make a distribution to the Stabilization Fund of the maximum amount possible that does not reduce the Insurance Fund's equity ratio below the normal operating level and does not reduce the Insurance Fund's available assets ratio below 1.0 percent.

#### (f) Investment of Stabilization Fund assets
* The Board may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Stabilization Fund as is not, in the Board's judgment, required to meet the current needs of the Stabilization Fund. Such investments shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury in public debt securities, with maturities suitable to the needs of the Stabilization Fund, as determined by the Board, and bearing interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity.

#### (g) Reports
* The Board shall submit an annual report to Congress on the financial condition and the results of the operation of the Stabilization Fund. The report is due to Congress within 30 days after each anniversary of the first advance made under subsection (c)(1). Because the Fund will use advances from the Treasury to meet corporate stabilization costs with full repayment of borrowings to Treasury at the Board's discretion not due until 7 years from the initial advance, to the extent operating expenses of the Fund exceed income, the financial condition of the Fund may reflect a deficit. With planned and required future repayments, the Board shall resolve all deficits prior to termination of the Fund.

#### (h) Closing of Stabilization Fund
* Within 90 days following the seventh anniversary of the initial Stabilization Fund advance, or earlier at the Board's discretion, the Board shall distribute any funds, property, or other assets remaining in the Stabilization Fund to the Insurance Fund and shall close the Stabilization Fund. If the Board extends the final repayment date as permitted under subsection (c)(3), the mandatory date for closing the Stabilization Fund shall be extended by the same number of days.
