#### (a) Congressional statement of policy
* It is the policy of the Congress that the Export-Import Bank of the United States should facilitate through loans, guarantees, and insurance (including coinsurance and reinsurance) those export transactions which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Bank, offer sufficient likelihood of repayment to justify the Bank's support in order to actively foster the foreign trade and long-term commercial interest of the United States.

* The Bank shall specially designate loans, guarantees, and insurance on the books of the Bank made under authority of this subchapter. In connection with guarantees and insurance, not less than 25 per centum of the related contractual liability of the Bank shall be taken into account for the purpose of applying the limitation imposed by section 635e of this title; but the full amount of the related contractual liability of such guarantees and insurance shall be taken into account for the purpose of applying the limitation in section 635(c)(1) of this title, concerning the amount of guarantees and insurance the Bank may have outstanding at any one time thereunder.

Reimbursement of the Bank by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amount of losses which are to be borne by the Secretary of the Treasury as aforesaid shall be from funds made available pursuant to section 635l of this title.
