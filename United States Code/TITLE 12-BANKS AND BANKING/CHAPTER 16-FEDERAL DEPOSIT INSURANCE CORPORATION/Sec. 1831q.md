* #### (2) Annual fiscal limitations
  * #### (A) In general
    * In each fiscal year during the 3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), the provisions of this section shall apply only—

      * (i) to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriations Acts for any losses resulting during the fiscal year from the sale of properties under this section, except that such amounts for losses may not exceed $30,000,000 in any fiscal year; and

  * #### (C) Authorization of appropriations
    * There are authorized to be appropriated, for each fiscal year during the 3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), such sums as may be necessary for any costs of the program under this section other than losses resulting from the sale of properties under this section.

  * #### (D) Other definitions
    * For purposes of this paragraph:

    * #### (i) Affordable housing discount
      * The term "affordable housing discount" means, with respect to any eligible residential or eligible condominium property transferred under this section by the Corporation, the difference (if any) between the realizable disposition value of the property and the actual sale price of the property under this section.

    * #### (ii) Realizable disposition value

Until such procedures are established, the Corporation may consider the realizable disposition value of any eligible residential or condominium property to be equal to the appraised value of the property.

* #### (3) Existing contracts
  * The provisions of this section shall not apply to any eligible residential property or any eligible condominium property that is subject to an agreement entered into by the Corporation before the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) that provides for any other disposition of the property.

The Corporation shall allow public agencies, nonprofit organizations, and qualifying households reasonable access to eligible single family property for purposes of inspection.

* #### (4) Exceptions to recapture requirement
  * #### (A) Relocation
    * The Corporation may in its discretion waive the applicability (i) to any qualifying household of the requirement under paragraph (3) and the requirements relating to residency of a qualifying household under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (p)(12), and (ii) to any low-income family of the requirement under paragraph (3) and the residency requirements under paragraph (2)(B)(ii). The Corporation may grant any such waiver only for good cause shown, including any necessary relocation of the qualifying household or low-income family.

  * #### (B) Other recapture provisions
    * The requirement under paragraph (3) shall not apply to any eligible single family property for which, upon resale by the qualifying household or low-income family during the 1-year period beginning upon initial acquisition by the household or family, a portion of the sale proceeds or any subsidy provided in connection with the acquisition of the property by the household or family is required to be recaptured or repaid under any other Federal, State, or local law (including section 143(m) of title 26) or regulation or under any sale agreement.

  * #### (A) Continued occupancy of current residents
    * No purchaser of an eligible multifamily property may terminate the occupancy of any person residing in the property on the date of purchase for purposes of meeting the low-income occupancy requirement applicable to the property under paragraph (7). The purchaser shall be considered to be in compliance with this subsection if each newly vacant dwelling unit is reserved for low-income occupancy until the low-income occupancy requirement is met.

  * #### (B) Financial infeasibility
    * The Secretary or the State housing finance agency for the State in which an eligible multifamily housing property is located may temporarily reduce the low-income occupancy requirements under paragraph (7) applicable to the property, if the Secretary or such agency determines that an owner's compliance with such requirements is no longer financially feasible. The owner of the property shall make a good-faith effort to return low-income occupancy to the level required under paragraph (7), and the Secretary or the State housing finance agency, as appropriate, shall review the reduction annually to determine whether financial infeasibility continues to exist.

#### (e) Rent limitations

#### (f) Preferences for sales
* #### (1) In general
  * In selling any eligible multifamily housing property or combinations of eligible residential properties, the Corporation shall give preference, among substantially similar offers, to the offer that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy or purchase by very low-income and low-income families and would retain such affordability for the longest term.

* #### (2) Multiproperty purchases
  * The Corporation shall give preference, among substantially similar offers made under paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection (d) to purchase more than one eligible multifamily housing property as a part of the same negotiation, to offers made by purchasers who agree to maintain low-income occupancy in each separate property purchased in compliance with the levels required for properties under subsection (d)(7)(A).

* #### (3) Definition of substantially similar offers

The Corporation may provide the loan at below market interest rates to the extent necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of eligible residential property and permit (i) a low-income family to purchase an eligible single family property under subsection (c), or (ii) a public agency or nonprofit organization to comply with the low-income occupancy requirements applicable to the purchase of an eligible residential property under subsection (c) or (d). The Corporation shall provide loans under this subparagraph in a form permitting sale or transfer of the loan to a subsequent holder. In providing financing for combinations of eligible multifamily housing properties under this section, the Corporation may hold a participating share, including a subordinate participation. The Corporation shall periodically provide, to a wide range of minority- and women-owned businesses engaged in providing affordable housing and to nonprofit organizations, more than 50 percent of the control of which is held by 1 or more minority individuals, that are engaged in providing affordable housing, information that is sufficient to inform such businesses and organizations of the availability and terms of financing under this subparagraph; such information may be provided directly, by notices published in periodicals and other publications that regularly provide information to such businesses or organizations, and through persons and organizations that regularly provide information or services to such businesses or organizations.
