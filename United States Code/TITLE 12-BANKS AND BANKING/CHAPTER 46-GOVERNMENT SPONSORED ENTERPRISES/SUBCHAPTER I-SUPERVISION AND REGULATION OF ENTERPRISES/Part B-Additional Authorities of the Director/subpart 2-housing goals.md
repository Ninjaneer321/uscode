* #### (2) Goals targets
  * #### (A) Calculation
    * The Director shall calculate, for each of the types of families described in subsection (a), the percentage, for each of the three years that most recently precede such year and for which information under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 [12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] is publicly available—

#### (f) Notice of determination and enterprise comment
* #### (1) Notice
  * Within 30 days of making a determination under subsection (d) regarding compliance of an enterprise for a year with a housing goal established under this section and before any public disclosure thereof, the Director shall provide notice of the determination to the enterprise, which shall include an analysis and comparison, by the Director, of the performance of the enterprise for the year and the targets for the year under subsection (e).

#### (g) Use of borrower income
* In monitoring the performance of each enterprise pursuant to the housing goals under this section and evaluating such performance (for purposes of section 4566 of this title), the Director shall consider a mortgagor's income to be such income at the time of origination of the mortgage.

#### (h) Consideration of properties with rental units
* Mortgages financing two- to four-unit owner-occupied properties shall count toward the achievement of the single-family housing goals under this section, if such properties otherwise meet the requirements under this section, notwithstanding the use of one or more units for rental purposes.

#### (i) Goals credit
* The Director shall determine whether an enterprise shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals established pursuant to section 4562 and 4563 of this title. In making any such determination, the Director shall consider whether a transaction or activity of an enterprise is substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase and either (1) creates a new market, or (2) adds liquidity to an existing market. No credit toward the achievement of the housing goals and subgoals established under this section may be given to the purchase of mortgages, including any transaction or activity of an enterprise determined to be substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase, that is determined to be unacceptable or contrary to good lending practices, inconsistent with safety and soundness, or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, pursuant to regulations issued by the Director.

### §4563. Multifamily special affordable housing goal
#### (a) Establishment of goal
* #### (1) In general
  * The Director shall, by regulation, establish a single annual goal, by either unit or dollar volume, of purchases by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to low-income families.

  * When establishing the goal under this section, the Director shall establish additional requirements for the purchase by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to very low-income families.

* #### (3) Reporting on smaller properties
  * The Director shall require each enterprise to report on the purchase by each enterprise of multifamily housing of a smaller or limited size that is affordable to low-income families, which may be based on multifamily projects of 5 to 50 units (as such numbers may be adjusted by the Director) or on mortgages of up to $5,000,000 (as such amount may be adjusted by the Director), and may, by regulation, establish such aditional requirements related to such units.

* #### (4) Factors
  * In establishing the goal and additional requirements under this section, the Director shall not consider segments of the market determined to be inconsistent with safety and soundness or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, and shall take into consideration—

    * (A) national multifamily mortgage credit needs and the ability of the enterprise to provide additional liquidity and stability for the multifamily mortgage market;

    * (B) the performance and effort of the enterprise in making mortgage credit available for multifamily housing in previous years;

    * (C) the size of the multifamily mortgage market for housing affordable to low-income and very low-income families, including the size of the multifamily markets for housing of a smaller or limited size;

    * (D) the ability of the enterprise to lead the market in making multifamily mortgage credit available, especially for multifamily housing described in paragraphs (1) and (2);

    * (E) the availability of public subsidies; and

    * (F) the need to maintain the sound financial condition of the enterprise.

#### (b) Units financed by housing finance agency bonds
* The Director shall give full credit toward the achievement of the multifamily special affordable housing goal under this section (for purposes of section 4566 of this title) to dwelling units in multifamily housing that otherwise qualifies under such goal and that is financed by tax-exempt or taxable bonds issued by a State or local housing finance agency, if such bonds, in whole or in part—

  * (1) are secured by a guarantee of the enterprise; or

  * (2) are purchased by the enterprise, except that the Director may give less than full credit for purchases of investment grade bonds, to the extent that such purchases do not provide a new market or add liquidity to an existing market.

#### (c) Measurement of performance
* The Director shall monitor the performance of each enterprise in meeting the goals established under this section and shall evaluate such performance (for purposes of section 4566 of this title) based on whether the rent levels are affordable. A rent level shall be considered to be affordable for purposes of this subsection for low-income families if it does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of such income category, with appropriate adjustments for unit size as measured by the number of bedrooms.

#### (d) Determination of compliance
* The Director shall determine, for each year that the housing goal under this section is in effect pursuant to section 4561(a) of this title, whether each enterprise has complied with such goal and the additional requirements under subsection (a)(2).

### §4564. Discretionary adjustment of housing goals
#### (a) Authority
* An enterprise may petition the Director in writing at any time during a year to reduce the level of any goal or subgoal for such year established pursuant to this subpart.

#### (b) Standard for reduction
* The Director may reduce the level for a goal or subgoal pursuant to such a petition only if—

  * (1) market and economic conditions or the financial condition of the enterprise require such action; or

  * (2) efforts to meet the goal or subgoal would result in the constraint of liquidity, over-investment in certain market segments, or other consequences contrary to the intent of this subpart, or section 1716(3) of this title or section 301(b)(3) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act (12 U.S.C. 1451 note), as applicable.

#### (c) Determination
* The Director shall, promptly upon receipt of a petition regarding a reduction, seek public comment on the reduction for a period of 30 days. The Director shall make a determination regarding any proposed reduction within 30 days after the expiration of such public comment period. The Director may extend such determination period for a single additional 15-day period, but only if the Director requests additional information from the enterprise.
