#### (b) Approval prior to foreclosure
* A mortgagee may foreclose the mortgage on, or acquire by deed in lieu of foreclosure, any eligible low-income housing project (as such term is defined in section 4119 of this title) only if the mortgagee also conveys title to the project to the Secretary in connection with a claim for insurance benefits.

#### (c) "Lower income families" defined
* For purposes of this section, the term "lower income families" has the meaning given such term in section 1437a(b)(2) of title 42.
