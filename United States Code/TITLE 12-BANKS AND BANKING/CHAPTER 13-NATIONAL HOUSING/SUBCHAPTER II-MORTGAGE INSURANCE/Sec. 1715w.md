Any stock or interest so purchased shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.

  * (2) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project, or 95 percent of the estimated value of the property or project in the case of a mortgagor that is a private nonprofit corporation or association (under the meaning given such term for purposes of section 1715l(d)(3) of this title), including—

    * (B) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.


* The Secretary shall not promulgate regulations or establish terms or conditions that interfere with the ability of the mortgagor and mortgagee to determine the interest rate; and

  * (4)(A) With respect to nursing homes and intermediate care facilities and combined nursing home and intermediate care facilities, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless he has received, from the State agency designated in accordance with section 604(a)(1) or section 1521 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 291d (a)(1), 300m] for the State in which is located the nursing home or intermediate care facility or combined nursing home and intermediate care facility covered by the mortgage, a certification that (i) there is a need for such home or facility or combined home and facility, and (ii) there are in force in such State or in the municipality or other political subdivision of the State in which the proposed home or facility or combined home and facility is to be located reasonable minimum standards of licensure and methods of operation governing it. No such mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary has received such assurance as he may deem satisfactory from the State agency that such standards will be applied and enforced with respect to any home or facility or combined home and facility located in the State for which mortgage insurance is provided under this section. If no such State agency exists, or if the State agency exists but is not empowered to provide a certification that there is a need for the home or facility or combined home and facility as required in clause (i) of the first sentence, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless (i) the State in which the home or facility or combined home and facility is located has conducted or commissioned and paid for the preparation of an independent study of market need and feasibility that (I) is prepared in accordance with the principles established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; (II) assesses, on a marketwide basis, the impact of the proposed home or facility or combined home and facility on, and its relationship to, other health care facilities and services, the percentage of excess beds, demographic projections, alternative health care delivery systems, and the reimbursement structure of the home, facility, or combined home and facility; (III) is addressed to and is acceptable to the Secretary in form and substance; and (IV) in the event the State does not prepare the study, is prepared by a financial consultant who is selected by the State or the applicant for mortgage insurance and is approved by the Secretary; and (ii) the State complies with the other provisions of this subparagraph that would otherwise be required to be met by a State agency designated in accordance with section 604(a)(1) or section 1521 of the Public Health Service Act.
