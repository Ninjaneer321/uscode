### SUBCHAPTER X—NATIONAL DEFENSE HOUSING INSURANCE

### §1750. Definitions
* As used in this subchapter, the terms "mortgage", "first mortgage", "mortgagee", "mortgagor", "maturity date", and "State" shall have the same meaning as in section 1707 of this title.

### §1750b. Insurance in critical areas
#### (a) Limitations; termination of certain commitments; requirements; discrimination against children
* This subchapter is designed to supplement systems of mortgage insurance under other provisions of this chapter in order to assist in providing adequate housing in areas which the President, pursuant to section 1591 of title 42, shall have determined to be critical defense housing areas. The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this section or section 1750g of this title as hereinafter provided any mortgage which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: _Provided_, That the property covered by the mortgage is in an area which the President, pursuant to section 1591 of title 42, shall have determined to be a critical defense housing area, and that the total number of dwelling units in properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter in any such area does not exceed the number authorized by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from time to time as needed in such area for defense purposes and to be insured pursuant to this subchapter: _Provided further_, That in the event the Secretary has issued a commitment to insure a mortgage under this section, which commitment was in force and effect on June 1, 1953, and the Secretary determines that, because of changes in defense requirements, there is reasonable doubt that such housing is needed for defense purposes and that it is probable that the mortgage would become immediately in default and claim made for payment under the mortgage insurance contract if the unit or units are completed and the mortgage insured, the Secretary is authorized, in the interest of conserving the General Insurance Fund, to pay (in cash from the General Insurance Fund) to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor such amount as the Secretary shall determine to be necessary to reimburse the mortgagor the amounts paid or to be paid by the mortgagor on account of labor performed and materials in place, less the Secretary's estimate of the reasonable salvage value of such materials, plus an allowance for development costs equal to 4 per centum of the principal amount of the mortgage specified in such commitment, and no payments shall be made pursuant to this proviso unless a claim therefor is filed not later than six months from date of the determination of lack of need and the claim is in such form and contains such supporting information, documents, and data as the Secretary may require: _Provided further_, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter shall not exceed such sum as may be authorized by the President from time to time for the purposes of this subchapter pursuant to his authority under section 1715h of this title: _Provided further_, That the Secretary shall have power to require properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter to be held for rental for such periods of time and at such rentals or other charges as he may prescribe; and, with respect to such properties being held for rental, (1) to require that the property be held by a mortgagor approved by him, and (2) to prescribe such requirements as he deems to be reasonable governing the method of operation and prohibiting or restricting sales of such properties or interests therein or agreements relating to such sales: _Provided further_, That the Secretary shall require each dwelling covered by a mortgage insured under this section, for which a commitment to insure is issued after August 2, 1954, to be held for rental for a period of not less than three years after the dwelling is made available for initial occupancy: _And provided further_, That no mortgage shall be insured under this subchapter unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for any property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certification to be filed with the Secretary. Violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500.

#### (b) Eligibility requirements
* To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall—

  * (1) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;

  * (2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the appraised value (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance) of a property, urban, suburban, or rural, upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for residential use for not more than two families in the aggregate, which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction, the construction of which is begun after September 1, 1951. The principal obligation of such mortgage shall not, however, exceed $8,100 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or $15,000 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence except that the Secretary may by regulation increase these amounts to not to exceed $9,000 and $16,000, respectively, in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require: _Provided_, That if the Secretary finds that it is not feasible within the aforesaid dollar amount limitations to construct dwellings containing three or four bedrooms per family unit without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability, he may increase such dollar amount limitations by not exceeding $1,080 for each additional bedroom (as defined by the Secretary) in excess of two contained in such family unit if he finds that such unit meets sound standards of livability as a three-bedroom or a four-bedroom unit as the case may be;

  * (3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed thirty years from the date of the insurance of the mortgage;

  * (4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;

  * (5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4½ per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;

  * (6) provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as herein provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and

  * (7) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.

#### (c) Premium charges; payments; needs of national defense as prerequisite; adjustments and refunds
* The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1½ per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: _Provided_, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this subchapter&nbsp; unless&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; finds&nbsp; that&nbsp; the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk in view of the needs of national defense. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage has continued to be insured under this subchapter until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. Upon application of the mortgagee with the consent of the mortgagor of a mortgage for which a commitment to insure has been issued pursuant to section 1709 of this title covering property on which the construction of the dwellings thereon was begun prior to the enactment of this subchapter and the determination of prevailing wages in the locality in accordance with section 1715c of this title, the Secretary is authorized, notwithstanding such beginning of construction, to convert such commitment to a commitment under section 1750g of this title; any charges or fees paid to the Secretary with respect to such insurance under section 1709 of this title shall be credited to charges or fees due the Secretary with respect to such insurance under section 1750g of this title; and the determination of prevailing wages in the locality for purposes of section 1715c of this title may be made by the Secretary of Labor at any time prior to the insurance under section 1750g of this title: _Provided_, That such mortgage, or the mortgage covering the same property executed in substitution therefor, is otherwise eligible for insurance under section 1750g of this title.

#### (d) Preference or priority in purchasing or renting properties
* Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or any other Act, except provisions of law enacted hereafter expressly referring to this subsection (d), the Secretary is further authorized to prescribe such procedures as are necessary to secure to persons engaged or to be engaged in national defense activities preference or priority of opportunity to purchase or rent properties, or interests therein, covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter.

#### (e) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility
* Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.

### §1750c. Mortgage insurance benefits
#### (a) Conveyance and assignment by mortgagee after foreclosure; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure
* In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under section 1750b of this title shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property, in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Secretary, or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment hereinafter provided, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage and a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure, the amount of all payments which have been made by the mortgagee for taxes, ground rents, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage, special assessments which are noted on the application for insurance or which become liens after the insurance of the mortgage, insurance of the mortgaged property, and any mortgage insurance premiums and by deducting from such total amount any amount received on account of the mortgage after either of such dates and any amount received as rent or other income from the property, less reasonable expenses incurred in handling the property, after either of such dates: _Provided_, That with respect to mortgages which are foreclosed before there shall have been paid on account of the principal obligation of the mortgage a sum equal to 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage was accepted for insurance, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary, on account of the cost of foreclosure (or of acquiring the property by other means) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount—

  * (1) not in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings and not in excess of $75; or

  * (2) not in excess of two-thirds of such cost, whichever is the greater: _Provided further_, That with respect to any debentures issued on or after September 2, 1964, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e)), include in debentures, in addition to amounts otherwise allowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: _And provided further_, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 302 and 306 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as now or hereafter amended, apply and which are insured under section 1750b of this title, and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of insurance premiums by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter.

#### (b) Consent to release of mortgagee or property
* The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.

#### (c) Debentures; form and denomination
* Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the amount of debentures to which the mortgagee is entitled under this section or section 1750g of this title and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $350, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.

#### (d) Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions
* The debentures issued under this section to any mortgagee shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default, except that debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the mortgage was accepted for insurance, but not to exceed 3 per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year. Such debentures shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, or gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, and shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event that the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures issued under this subchapter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.

#### (e) Certificate of claim; division of excess proceeds
* The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee under this section shall be for an amount determined in accordance with, and shall contain provisions and shall be paid in accordance with, the provisions of section 1710(e) and section 1710(f) of this title.

#### (f) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power to deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit, in his discretion, any properties conveyed to him in exchange for debentures and certificates of claim as provided in this section; and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against mortgagors assigned by mortgagees to the Secretary as provided in this subchapter: _Provided_, That section 6101 of title 41 shall not be construed to apply to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyances, deeds of release, assignments, and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: _Provided_, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint.

#### (g) Mortgagor's or mortgagee's interest in property or claim conveyed
* No mortgagee or mortgagor shall have, and no certification of claim shall be construed to give to any mortgagee or mortgagor, any right or interest in any property conveyed to the Secretary or in any claim assigned to him; nor shall the Secretary owe any duty to any mortgagee or mortgagor with respect to the handling or disposal of any such property or the collection of any such claim.

### §1750e. Taxation
