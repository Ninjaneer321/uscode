#### (g) Provisions of services
* #### (1) In general

The Secretary may permit the provision of services to elderly persons who are not residents if the participation of such persons will not adversely affect the cost-effectiveness or operation of the program or add significantly to the need for assistance under this Act.

#### (h) Development cost limitations
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall periodically establish reasonable development cost limitations by market area for various types and sizes of supportive housing for the elderly by publishing a notice of the cost limitations in the Federal Register. The cost limitations shall reflect—

    * (C) the cost of special design features necessary to make the housing accessible to elderly persons;

    * (D) the cost of special design features necessary to make individual dwelling units meet the physical needs of elderly project residents;

    * (E) the cost of congregate space necessary to accommodate the provision of supportive services to elderly project residents;

* #### (4) Incentives for savings
  * #### (A) Special housing account
    * The Secretary shall use the development cost limitations established under paragraph (1) or (2) to calculate the amount of financing to be made available to individual owners. Owners which incur actual development costs that are less than the amount of financing shall be entitled to retain 50 percent of the savings in a special housing account. Such percentage shall be increased to 75 percent for owners which add energy efficiency features which—

      * (i) exceed the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of title 42;

      * (ii) substantially reduce the life-cycle cost of the housing;

      * (iii) reduce gross rent requirements; and

      * (iv) enhance tenant comfort and convenience.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, assistance amounts provided under this section may be treated as amounts not derived from a Federal grant.

#### (j) Miscellaneous provisions
* #### (1) Technical assistance
  * The Secretary shall make available appropriate technical assistance to assure that applicants having limited resources, particularly minority applicants, are able to participate more fully in the program carried out under this section.

  * #### (B) Reduction of requirement
    * The Secretary may reduce or waive the owner deposit specified under paragraph (1) for individual applicants if the Secretary finds that such waiver or reduction is necessary to achieve the purposes of this section and the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has the capacity to manage and maintain the housing in accordance with this section. The Secretary shall reduce or waive the requirement of the owner deposit under paragraph (1) in the case of a nonprofit applicant that is not affiliated with a national sponsor, as determined by the Secretary.

* #### (4) Notice of appeal
  * The Secretary shall notify an owner not less than 30 days prior to canceling any reservation of assistance provided under this section.

Any owner that uses residual receipts under this paragraph shall submit to the Secretary a report, not less than annually, describing the uses of the residual receipts.
