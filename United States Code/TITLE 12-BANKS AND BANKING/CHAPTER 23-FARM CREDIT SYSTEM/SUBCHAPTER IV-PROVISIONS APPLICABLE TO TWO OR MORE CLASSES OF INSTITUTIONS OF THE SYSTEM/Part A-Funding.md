### §2153. Power to borrow; issuance of notes, bonds, debentures, and other obligations
* Each of the banks of the System, in order to obtain funds for its authorized purposes, shall have power, subject to regulation by the Farm Credit Administration, and subject to the limitations of paragraph (e) of this section, to—

* (a) Borrow money from or loan to any other institution of the System, borrow from any commercial bank or other lending institution, issue its notes or other evidence of debt on its own individual responsibility and full faith and credit, and invest its excess funds in such sums, at such times, and on such terms and conditions as it may determine.

* (b) Issue its own notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations, fully collateralized as provided in section 2154(c) of this title by the notes, mortgages, and security instruments it holds in the performance of its functions under this chapter in such sums, maturities, rates of interest, and terms and conditions of each issue as it may determine with approval of the Farm Credit Administration.

* (c) Join with any or all banks organized and operating under the same subchapter of this chapter in borrowing or in issuance of consolidated notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations as may be agreed with approval of the Farm Credit Administration.

* (d) Join with other banks of the System in issuance of System-wide notes, bonds, debentures, and other obligations in the manner, form, amounts, and on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon with approval of the Farm Credit Administration. Such System-wide issue by the participating banks and such participations by each bank shall not exceed the limits to which each such bank is subject in the issuance of its individual or consolidated obligations and each such issue shall be subject to approval of the Farm Credit Administration: _Provided, however_, There shall be no issues of System-wide obligations without the concurrence of the boards of directors of each bank and the approval of the Farm Credit Administration for such issues shall be conditioned on and be evidence of the compliance with this provision.

* (e) No bank or banks shall issue notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations individually or in concert with one or more banks of the System other than through the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation under any provision of this chapter except under subsection (a) of this section: _Provided_, That any bank or banks may issue investment bonds or like obligations other than through the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation if the interest rate is not in excess of the interest allowable on savings deposits of commercial banks of comparable amounts and maturities under Federal Reserve regulation on its member banks.

### §2154. Capital adequacy of banks and institutions
#### (a) Minimum levels of capital
* The Farm Credit Administration shall cause System institutions to achieve and maintain adequate capital by establishing minimum levels of capital for such System institutions and by using such other methods as the Farm Credit Administration deems appropriate. The Farm Credit Administration may establish such minimum level of capital for a System institution as the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, deems to be necessary or appropriate in light of the particular circumstances of the System institution.

#### (b) Failure to maintain minimum levels; directives; plans for achieving minimum levels; proposals affecting compliance
* (1) Failure of a System institution to maintain capital at or above its minimum level as established under subsection (a) may be deemed by the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice within the meaning of this chapter.

* (2) In addition to, or in lieu of, any other action authorized by law, including paragraph (1), the Farm Credit Administration may issue a directive to a System institution that fails to maintain capital at or above its required level as established under subsection (a). Such directive may require the System institution to submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the Farm Credit Administration describing the means and timing by which the System institution shall achieve its required capital level, but may not require merger or consolidation without a majority vote of the voting stockholders or the contributors to the guaranty fund of the institution.

* (3) The Farm Credit Administration may consider such System institution's progress in adhering to any plan required under paragraph (2) whenever such System institution, or an affiliate thereof, seeks the requisite approval of the Farm Credit Administration for any proposal that would divert earnings, diminish capital, or otherwise impede such System institution's progress in achieving its minimum capital level. The Farm Credit Administration may deny such approval where it determines that such proposal would adversely affect the ability of the System institution to comply with such plan.

#### (c) Enhancement of capital adequacy of banks
* Each bank shall have on hand at the time of issuance of any note, bond, debenture, or other similar obligation and at all times thereafter maintain, free from any lien or other pledge, notes and other obligations representing loans made under this chapter or real or personal property acquired in connection with loans made under this chapter, obligations of the United States or any agency thereof direct or fully guaranteed, other bank assets (including marketable securities) approved by the Farm Credit Administration, or cash, in an aggregate value equal to the total amount of notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations outstanding for which the bank is primarily liable.

* As used in this section:

    * (E) any other debt or equity instruments or other accounts that the Farm Credit Administration determines appropriate to be considered permanent capital.

* #### (2) Stock
  * The term "stock" means voting and nonvoting stock (including preferred stock), equivalent contributions to a guaranty fund, participation certificates, allocated equities, and other forms and types of equities.

#### (b) Adoption of bylaws
* Subject to approval by shareholders under subsection (c)(2), each bank and association shall adopt bylaws, developed by its board of directors, that provide for the capitalization of the institution in accordance with subsection (c)(1).

  * Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the bylaws adopted under subsection (b)—

    * (A) shall provide for such classes, par value, and amounts of the stock of the institution, the manner in which such stock shall be issued, transferred, and retired, and the payment of dividends and patronage refunds, as determined appropriate by the Board of Directors, subject to this section;

    * (B) may provide for the charging of loan origination fees as determined appropriate by the Board of Directors;

* #### (2) Exceptions
  * Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the payment of noncash patronage refunds by any institution exempt from Federal income tax if the entire refund paid qualifies as permanent capital.

  * Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the case of a loan sold to a secondary market under subchapter VIII, paragraph (1) shall apply regardless of whether the bank or association retains a subordinated participation interest in a loan or pool of loans or contributes to a cash reserve.

* #### (3) Exception
  * #### (A) In general
    * Subject to subparagraph (B) and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a loan designated for sale under paragraph (1)(A) is not sold into a secondary market during the 180-day period that begins on the date of the designation, the voting stock or participation certificate purchase requirement that would otherwise apply to the loan in the absence of a bylaw provision described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be effective.

  * #### (B) Retirement

* (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "available collateral" means the amount (determined at the close of the last calendar quarter ending before such call) by which a bank's collateral as described in section 2154 of this title exceeds the collateral required to support the bank's outstanding notes, bonds, debentures, and other similar obligations.
