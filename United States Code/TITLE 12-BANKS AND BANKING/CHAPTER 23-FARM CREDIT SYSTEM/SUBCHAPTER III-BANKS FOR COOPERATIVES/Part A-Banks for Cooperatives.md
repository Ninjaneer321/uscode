### §2130. Ownership of stock by borrowers
* (a) Each borrower entitled to hold voting stock shall, at the time a loan is made by a bank for cooperatives, own at least one share of voting stock and shall be required by the bank to invest in additional voting stock or nonvoting investment stock at that time, or from time to time, as the lending bank may determine, but the requirement for investment in stock at the time the loan is closed shall not exceed an amount equal to 10 per centum of the face amount of the loan. Such additional ownership requirements may be based on the face amount of the loan, the outstanding loan balance or on a percentage of the interest payable by the borrower during any year or during any quarter thereof, or upon such other basis as the bank determines will provide adequate capital for the operation of the bank and equitable ownership thereof among borrowers.

* (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the purchase of stock need not be required with respect to that part of any loan made by a bank for cooperatives which it sells to or makes in participation with financial institutions other than any of the banks for cooperatives. In such cases the distribution of earnings of the bank for cooperatives shall be on the basis of the interest in the loan retained by such bank.

### §2131. Loans
#### (a) Interest rates and charges
* Loans made by a bank for cooperatives shall bear interest at a rate or rates determined by the board of directors of the bank from time to time. In setting rates and charges, it shall be the objective to provide the types of credit needed by eligible borrowers at the lowest reasonable cost on a sound business basis, taking into account the net cost of money to the bank, necessary reserves and expenses of the bank, and services provided. The loan documents may provide for the interest rate or rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan, in accordance with the rate or rates currently being charged by the bank.

#### (b) Security
* Loans shall be made upon such terms, conditions, and security, if any, as may be determined by the bank in accordance with regulations of the Farm Credit Administration.

#### (c) Lien
* Each bank for cooperatives shall have a first lien on all stock or other equities in the bank as collateral for the payment of any indebtedness of the owner thereof to the bank.

#### (d) Cancellation; application on indebtedness

In no event shall the bank's equities be retired or canceled if the retirement or cancellation would adversely affect the bank's capital structure, as determined by the Farm Credit Administration.

### §2132. Earnings and reserves; application of savings
#### (a) Application of savings
* At the end of each fiscal year, the net savings shall, under regulations prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration, continue to be applied on a cooperative basis with provision for sound, adequate capitalization to meet the changing financing needs of eligible cooperative borrowers and prudent corporate fiscal management, to the end that current year's patrons carry their fair share of the capitalization, ultimate expenses, and reserves related to the year's operations and the remaining net savings shall be distributed as patronage refunds as provided in subsection (b). Such regulations may provide for application of net savings to the restoration or maintenance of an allocated surplus account, reasonable additions to unallocated surplus, or to unallocated reserves after payment of operating expenses, and provide for allocations to patrons not qualified under title 26, or payment of such per centum of patronage refunds in cash, as the board may determine.

#### (b) Patronage refunds
* The net savings of each bank for cooperatives, after the earnings for the fiscal year have been applied in accordance with subsection (a) of this section shall be paid in stock, participation certificates, or cash, or in any of them, as determined by its board, as patronage refunds to borrowers to whom such refunds are payable who are borrowers of the fiscal year for which such patronage refunds are distributed. All patronage refunds shall be paid in proportion that the amount of interest and service fees on the loans to each borrower during the year bears to the interest and service fees on the loans of all borrowers during the year or on such other proportionate patronage basis as may be approved by the board of directors.

#### (c) Loss carryover
* In the event of a net loss in any fiscal year after providing for all operating expenses (including reasonable valuation reserves and losses in excess of any applicable reserves), such loss may be carried forward or carried back, if appropriate, or otherwise shall be absorbed by charges to unallocated reserve or surplus accounts established after December 10, 1971; charges to allocated contingency reserve account; charges to allocated surplus accounts; charges to other contingency reserve and surplus accounts; the impairment of voting stock; or the impairment of all other stock.

#### (d) Charge of unrecognized costs or expenses to reserve, surplus, or patronage allocations
* Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section any costs or expenses attributable to a prior year or years but not recognized in determining the net savings for such year or years may be charged to reserves or surplus of the bank or to patronage allocations for such years, as may be determined by the board of directors.

#### (e) Payment of patronage refunds in cash
* A bank for cooperatives may pay in cash such portion of its patronage refunds as will permit its taxable income to be determined without taking into account savings applied as allocated surplus, allocated contingency reserves, and patronage refunds under subsection (a) of this section.

### §2133. Distribution of assets on liquidation or dissolution
* In the case of liquidation or dissolution of any bank for cooperatives, after payment or retirement, first, of all liabilities; second, of all capital stock issued before January 1, 1956, at par, and all nonvoting stock at par; and third, all voting stock at par; any surplus and reserves existing on January 1, 1956, shall be paid to the holders of stock issued before that date, and voting stock pro rata; and any remaining allocated surplus and reserves shall be distributed to those entities to which they are allocated on the books of the bank, and any other remaining surplus shall be paid to the holders of outstanding voting stock. If it should become necessary to use any surplus or reserves to pay any liabilities or to retire any capital stock, unallocated reserves or surplus, allocated reserves and surplus shall be exhausted in accordance with rules prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration.

### §2134. Taxation
* Each bank for cooperatives and its obligations are instrumentalities of the United States and as such any and all notes, debentures, and other obligations issued by such bank shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States or any State, territorial, or local taxing authority, except that interest on such obligations shall be subject to Federal income taxation in the hands of the holder.
