### SUBCHAPTER II—SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL ENHANCEMENT

### §4741. Findings and purposes
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) small business concerns are a vital part of the economy, accounting for the majority of new jobs, new products, and new services created in the United States;

  * (3) commercial banks are the most important suppliers of debt capital to small business concerns in the United States;

  * (5) as a result of such incentives, many small business concerns with economically sound financing needs are unable to obtain access to needed debt capital;

  * (6) the small business capital access programs implemented by certain States are a flexible and efficient tool to assist financial institutions in providing access to needed debt capital for many small business concerns in a manner consistent with safety and soundness regulations;

  * (7) a small business capital access program would complement other programs which assist small business concerns in obtaining access to capital; and

  * (8) Federal policy can stimulate and accelerate efforts by States to implement small business capital access programs by providing an incentive to States, while leaving the administration of such programs to each participating State.

#### (b) Purposes
* By encouraging States to implement administratively efficient capital access programs that encourage commercial banks and other depository institutions to provide access to debt capital for a broad portfolio of small business concerns, and thereby promote a more efficient and effective debt market, the purposes of this subchapter are—

  * (1) to promote economic opportunity and growth;

  * (2) to create jobs;

    * (B) is an early loan, such payment shall not be deemed fully to satisfy the claim of the participating financial institution, and at such time as the remaining balance of the claim does not exceed 75 percent of the balance in the reserve fund, the participating State shall, upon the request of the participating financial institution, pay any remaining amount of the claim.

#### (n) Denial of claims

    * (C) may provide that if—

      * (i) a participating financial institution makes a loan to a borrower that is a refinancing of a loan previously made to the borrower by the participating financial institution or an affiliate of the participating financial institution;

      * (ii) such prior loan was not enrolled in the Program; and

      * (iii) additional or new financing is extended by the participating financial institution as part of the refinancing,

  * Notwithstanding subsection (b) or (d), the participation agreement, if explicitly authorized by a statute enacted by the State before September 23, 1994, may allow a participating financial institution to treat the premium charges paid by the participating financial institution and the borrower into the reserve fund, and interest or income earned on funds in the reserve fund that are deemed to be attributable to such premium charges, as assets of the participating financial institution for accounting purposes, subject to withdrawal by the participating financial institution only—

    * (A) for the payment of claims approved by the participating State in accordance with this section; and

    * (B) upon the participating financial institution's withdrawal from authority to make new loans under the Program.

* #### (2) Payment of post-withdrawal claims
