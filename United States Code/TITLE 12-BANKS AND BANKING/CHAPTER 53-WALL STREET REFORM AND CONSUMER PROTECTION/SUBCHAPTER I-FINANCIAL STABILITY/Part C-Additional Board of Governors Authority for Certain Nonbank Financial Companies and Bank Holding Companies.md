      * (i) risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, unless the Board of Governors, in consultation with the Council, determines that such requirements are not appropriate for a company subject to more stringent prudential standards because of the activities of such company (such as investment company activities or assets under management) or structure, in which case, the Board of Governors shall apply other standards that result in similarly stringent risk controls;

      * (ii) liquidity requirements;

      * (iii) overall risk management requirements;

      * (iv) resolution plan requirements; and

#### (b) Requirement
* #### (1) In general
  * #### (A) Board authority
    * If a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors conducts activities other than those that are determined to be financial in nature or incidental thereto under section 1843(k) of this title, the Board of Governors may require such company to establish and conduct all or a portion of such activities that are determined to be financial in nature or incidental thereto in or through an intermediate holding company established pursuant to regulation of the Board of Governors, not later than 90 days (or such longer period as the Board of Governors may deem appropriate) after the date on which the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors is notified of the determination of the Board of Governors under this section.

  * #### (B) Necessary actions
    * Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board of Governors shall require a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors to establish an intermediate holding company if the Board of Governors makes a determination that the establishment of such intermediate holding company is necessary to—

      * (i) appropriately supervise activities that are determined to be financial in nature or incidental thereto; or

      * (ii) to ensure that supervision by the Board of Governors does not extend to the commercial activities of such nonbank financial company.

  * For purposes of this subsection, activities that are determined to be financial in nature or incidental thereto under section 1843(k) of this title, as described in paragraph (1), shall not include internal financial activities, including internal treasury, investment, and employee benefit functions. With respect to any internal financial activity engaged in for the company or an affiliate and a non-affiliate of such company during the year prior to July 21, 2010, such company (or an affiliate that is not an intermediate holding company or subsidiary of an intermediate holding company) may continue to engage in such activity, as long as not less than 2/3 of the assets or 2/3 of the revenues generated from the activity are from or attributable to such company or an affiliate, subject to review by the Board of Governors, to determine whether engaging in such activity presents undue risk to such company or to the financial stability of the United States.

* #### (3) Source of strength
  * A company that directly or indirectly controls an intermediate holding company established under this section shall serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary intermediate holding company.

* #### (4) Parent company reports

* #### (5) Limited parent company enforcement
  * #### (A) In general

  * #### (B) Application of other Act
    * Any violation of this subsection by any company that controls an intermediate holding company may also be treated as a violation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.] for purposes of subparagraph (A).

  * #### (C) No effect on other authority
    * No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as limiting any authority of the Board of Governors or any other Federal agency under any other provision of law.

#### (c) Regulations
* The Board of Governors—

  * (1) shall promulgate regulations to establish the criteria for determining whether to require a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors to establish an intermediate holding company under subsection (b); and

  * (2) may promulgate regulations to establish any restrictions or limitations on transactions between an intermediate holding company or a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and its affiliates, as necessary to prevent unsafe and unsound practices in connection with transactions between such company, or any subsidiary thereof, and its parent company or affiliates that are not subsidiaries of such company, except that such regulations shall not restrict or limit any transaction in connection with the bona fide acquisition or lease by an unaffiliated person of assets, goods, or services.

Except as otherwise specified in part A or C, not later than 18 months after the effective date of this Act, the Board of Governors shall issue final regulations to implement parts A and C, and the amendments made thereunder.

### §5369. Avoiding duplication

#### (b) Considerations
* In developing the criteria under subsection (a), the Board of Governors shall take into account the factors for consideration described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title in determining whether a U.S. nonbank financial company or foreign nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors.

#### (c) Rule of construction
