* #### (3) Considerations
  * In making recommendations concerning prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Council shall—

    * (A) take into account differences among nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based on—

    * (E) an evaluation of the effects of such requirement on the international competitiveness of companies subject to the requirement and the prospects for international coordination in establishing such requirement; and

    * (F) recommendations for implementing regulations.
