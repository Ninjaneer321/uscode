### PART 2—OTHER AUTHORITY

### §2131. Authorization of appropriation for GATT revision
* There are authorized to be appropriated annually such sums as may be necessary for the payment by the United States of its share of the expenses of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This authorization does not imply approval or disapproval by the Congress of all articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

### §2132. Balance-of-payments authority
#### (a) Presidential proclamations of temporary import surcharges and temporary limitations on imports through quotas in situations of fundamental international payments problems
* Whenever fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to restrict imports—

  * (1) to deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits.

  * (2) to prevent an imminent and significant depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, or

  * (3) to cooperate with other countries in correcting an international balance-of-payments disequilibrium,


* the President shall proclaim, for a period not exceeding 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)—

  * (A) a temporary import surcharge, not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem, in the form of duties (in addition to those already imposed, if any) on articles imported into the United States;

  * (B) temporary limitations through the use of quotas on the importation of articles into the United States; or

  * (C) both a temporary import surcharge described in subparagraph (A) and temporary limitations described in subparagraph (B).


* The authority delegated under subparagraph (B) (and so much of subparagraph (C) as relates to subparagraph (B)) may be exercised (i) only if international trade or monetary agreements to which the United States is a party permit the imposition of quotas as a balance-of-payments measure, and (ii) only to the extent that the fundamental imbalance cannot be dealt with effectively by a surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C). Any temporary import surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C) shall be treated as a regular customs duty.

#### (b) Import restrictions not imposed when contrary to national interest of United States
* If the President determines that the imposition of import restrictions under subsection (a) will be contrary to the national interest of the United States, then he may refrain from proclaiming such restrictions and he shall—

  * (1) immediately inform Congress of his determination, and

  * (2) immediately convene the group of congressional official advisers designated under section 2211(a) of this title and consult with them as to the reasons for such determination.

#### (c) Presidential proclamations liberalizing imports
* Whenever the President determines that fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to increase imports—

  * (1) to deal with large and persistent United States balance-of-trade surpluses, as determined on the basis of the cost-insurance-freight value of imports, as reported by the Bureau of the Census, or

  * (2) to prevent significant appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets,


* the President is authorized to proclaim, for a period of 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)—

  * (A) a temporary reduction (of not more than 5 percent ad valorem) in the rate of duty on any article; and

  * (B) a temporary increase in the value or quantity of articles which may be imported under any import restriction, or a temporary suspension of any import restriction.


* Import liberalizing actions proclaimed pursuant to this subsection shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except that the President shall not proclaim measures under this subsection with respect to those articles where in his judgment such action will cause or contribute to material injury to firms or workers in any domestic industry, including agriculture, mining, fishing, or commerce, or to impairment of the national security, or will otherwise be contrary to the national interest.

#### (d) Nondiscriminatory treatment of import restricting actions
* (1) Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be applied consistently with the principle of nondiscriminatory treatment. In addition, any quota proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subsection (a) shall be applied on a basis which aims at a distribution of trade with the United States approaching as closely as possible that which various foreign countries might have expected to obtain in the absence of such restrictions.

* (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the President determines that the purposes of this section will best be served by action against one or more countries having large or persistent balance-of-payments surpluses, he may exempt all other countries from such action.

* (3) After such time when there enters into force for the United States new rules regarding the application of surcharges as part of a reform of internationally agreed balance-of-payments adjustment procedures, the exemption authority contained in paragraph (2) shall be applied consistently with such new international rules.

* (4) It is the sense of Congress that the President seek modifications in international agreements aimed at allowing the use of surcharges in place of quantitative restrictions (and providing rules to govern the use of such surcharges) as a balance-of-payments adjustment measure within the context of arrangements for an equitable sharing of balance-of-payments adjustment responsibility among deficit and surplus countries.

#### (e) Broad and uniform application of import restricting actions
* Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except where the President determines, consistently with the purposes of this section, that certain articles should not be subject to import restricting actions because of the needs of the United States economy. Such exceptions shall be limited to the unavailability of domestic supply at reasonable prices, the necessary importation of raw materials, avoiding serious dislocations in the supply of imported goods, and other similar factors. In addition, uniform exceptions may be made where import restricting actions will be unnecessary or ineffective in carrying out the purposes of this section, such as with respect to articles already subject to import restrictions, goods in transit, or goods under binding contract. Neither the authorization of import restricting actions nor the determination of exceptions with respect to product coverage shall be made for the purpose of protecting individual domestic industries from import competition.

#### (f) Quantitative limitations
* Any quantitative limitation proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (a) on the quantity or value, or both, of an article—

  * (1) shall permit the importation of a quantity or value which is not less than the quantity or value of such article imported into the United States from the foreign countries to which such limitation applies during the most recent period which the President determines is representative of imports of such article, and

  * (2) shall take into account any increase since the end of such representative period in domestic consumption of such article and like or similar articles of domestic manufacture or production.

#### (g) Suspension, modification, or termination of proclamations
* The President may at any time, consistent with the provisions of this section, suspend, modify, or terminate, in whole or in part, any proclamation under this section either during the initial 150-day period of effectiveness or as extended by subsequent Act of Congress.

#### (h) Termination of tariff concessions
* No provision of law authorizing the termination of tariff concessions shall be used to impose a surcharge on imports into the United States.

### §2133. Compensation authority
#### (a) New concessions
* Whenever—

  * (1) any action taken under part 1 of subchapter II or subchapter III, or under part 2 of subchapter IV of this chapter; or

  * (2) any judicial or administrative tariff reclassification that becomes final after August 23, 1988;


* increases or imposes any duty or other import restriction, the President—

  * (A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities for the purpose of granting new concessions as compensation in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions; and

  * (B) may proclaim such modification or continuance of any existing duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such agreement.

#### (b) Reductions in rates of duty
* (1) No proclamation shall be made pursuant to subsection (a) decreasing any rate of duty to a rate which is less than 70 percent of the existing rate of duty.

* (2) Where the rate of duty in effect at any time is an intermediate stage under section 2902(a) of this title, the proclamation made pursuant to subsection (a) may provide for the reduction of each rate of duty at each such stage proclaimed under such section 2902(a) of this title by not more than 30 percent of such rate of duty, and may provide for a final rate of duty which is not less than 70 percent of the rate of duty proclaimed as the final stage under such section 2902(a) of this title.

* (3) If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to an article, he may exceed the limitations provided by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection by not more than the lesser of—

  * (A) the difference between such limitation and the next lower whole number, or

  * (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.


* (4) Any concessions granted under subsection (a)(1) shall be reduced and terminated according to substantially the same time schedule for reduction applicable to the relevant action under sections 2253(e) and 2254 of this title.

#### (c) Consideration of past violations of trade concessions
* Before entering into any trade agreement under this section with any foreign country or instrumentality, the President shall consider whether such country or instrumentality has violated trade concessions of benefit to the United States and such violation has not been adequately offset by the action of the United States or by such country or instrumentality.

#### (d) Basic authority for trade agreements as authority for granting new concessions as compensation
* Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the authority delegated under section 2902 of this title shall be used for the purpose of granting new concessions as compensation within the meaning of this section until such authority terminates.

#### (e) International obligations determination prerequisite to application of authority
* The provisions of this section shall apply by reason of action taken under subchapter III only if the President determines that action authorized under this section is necessary or appropriate to meet the international obligations of the United States.

### §2134. Two-year residual authority to negotiate duties
#### (a) Trade agreements
* Whenever the President determines that any existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President—

  * (1) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities thereof, and

  * (2) may proclaim such modification or continuance of any existing duty, such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.

#### (b) Maximum volume of imported articles subject to reduction of duties or continuance of duty-free or excise treatment
* Agreements entered into under this section in any 1-year period shall not provide for the reduction of duties, or the continuance of duty-free or excise treatment, for articles which account for more than 2 percent of the value of United States imports for the most recent 12-month period for which import statistics are available.

#### (c) Maximum reduction in duties
* (1) No proclamation shall be made pursuant to subsection (a) decreasing any rate of duty to a rate which is less than 80 percent of the existing rate of duty.

* (2) No proclamation shall be made pursuant to subsection (a) decreasing or increasing any rate of duty to a rate which is lower or higher than the corresponding rate which would have resulted if the maximum authority granted by section 2111 of this title with respect to such article had been exercised.

* (3) Where the rate of duty in effect at any time is an intermediate stage under section 2119 of this title, the proclamation made pursuant to subsection (a) may provide for the reduction of each rate of duty at each such stage proclaimed under section 2111 of this title by not more than 20 percent of such rate of duty, and, subject to the limitation in paragraph (2), may provide for a final rate of duty which is not less than 80 percent of the rate of duty proclaimed as the final stage under section 2111 of this title.

* (4) If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to an article, he may exceed the limitations provided by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection by not more than the lesser of—

  * (A) the difference between such limitation and the next lower whole number, or

  * (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.

#### (d) Two-year period of authority
* Agreements may be entered into under this section only during the 2-year period which immediately follows the close of the period during which agreements may be entered into under section 2111 of this title.

### §2135. Termination and withdrawal authority
#### (a) Grant of authority for termination or withdrawal at end of period specified in agreement
* Every trade agreement entered into under this chapter shall be subject to termination, in whole or in part, or withdrawal, upon due notice, at the end of a period specified in the agreement. Such period shall be not more than 3 years from the date on which the agreement becomes effective. If the agreement is not terminated or withdrawn from at the end of the period so specified, it shall be subject to termination or withdrawal thereafter upon not more than 6 months' notice.

#### (b) Authority to terminate proclamations at any time
* The President may at any time terminate, in whole or in part, any proclamation made under this chapter.

#### (c) Increased duties or other import restrictions following withdrawal, suspension, or modification of obligations with respect to trade of foreign countries or instrumentalities
* Whenever the United States, acting in pursuance of any of its rights or obligations under any trade agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter, section 1821 of this title, or section 1351 of this title, withdraws, suspends, or modifies any obligation with respect to the trade of any foreign country or instrumentality thereof, the President is authorized to proclaim increased duties or other import restrictions, to the extent, at such times, and for such periods as he deems necessary or appropriate, in order to exercise the rights or fulfill the obligations of the United States. No proclamation shall be made under this subsection increasing any existing duty to a rate more than 50 percent above the rate set forth in rate column numbered 2 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, as in effect on January 1, 1975, or 20 percent ad valorem above the rate existing on January 1, 1975, whichever is higher.

#### (d) Retaliatory authority
* Whenever any foreign country or instrumentality withdraws, suspends, or modifies the application of trade agreement obligations of benefit to the United States without granting adequate compensation therefor, the President, in pursuance of rights granted to the United States under any trade agreement and to the extent necessary to protect United States economic interests (including United States balance of payments), may—

  * (1) withdraw, suspend, or modify the application of substantially equivalent trade agreement obligations of benefit to such foreign country or instrumentality, and

  * (2) proclaim under subsection (c) such increased duties or other import restrictions as are appropriate to effect adequate compensation from such foreign country or instrumentality.

#### (e) Continuation of duties or other import restrictions after termination of or withdrawal from agreements
* Duties or other import restrictions required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter, section 1821 of this title, or section 1351 of this title shall not be affected by any termination, in whole or in part, of such agreement or by the withdrawal of the United States from such agreement and shall remain in effect after the date of such termination or withdrawal for 1 year, unless the President by proclamation provides that such rates shall be restored to the level at which they would be but for the agreement. Within 60 days after the date of any such termination or withdrawal, the President shall transmit to the Congress his recommendations as to the appropriate rates of duty for all articles which were affected by the termination or withdrawal or would have been so affected but for the preceding sentence.

#### (f) Public hearings
* Before taking any action pursuant to subsection (b), (c), or (d), the President shall provide for a public hearing during the course of which interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard, unless he determines that such prior hearings will be contrary to the national interest because of the need for expeditious action, in which case he shall provide for a public hearing promptly after such action.

### §2136. Reciprocal nondiscriminatory treatment
#### (a) Direct and indirect imports
* Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or in any other provision of law, any duty or other import restriction or duty-free treatment proclaimed in carrying out any trade agreement under this subchapter shall apply to products of all foreign countries, whether imported directly or indirectly.

#### (b) Presidential determination of whether major industrial countries have made substantially equivalent concessions to the United States
* The President shall determine, after the conclusion of all negotiations entered into under this chapter or at the end of the 5-year period beginning on January 3, 1975, whichever is earlier, whether any major industrial country has failed to make concessions under trade agreements entered into under this chapter which provide competitive opportunities for the commerce of the United States in such country substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities, provided by concessions made by the United States under trade agreements entered into under this chapter, for the commerce of such country in the United States.

#### (c) Major industrial countries
* For purposes of this section, "major industrial country" means Canada, the European Economic Community, the individual member countries of such Community, Japan, and any other foreign country designated by the President for purposes of this subsection.

### §2137. Reservation of articles for national security or other reasons
#### (a) National security considerations
* No proclamation shall be made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter reducing or eliminating the duty or other import restriction on any article if the President determines that such reduction or elimination would threaten to impair the national security.

#### (b) Action taken under other laws
* While there is in effect with respect to any article any action taken under section 2253 of this title, or section 1862 or 1981 of this title, the President shall reserve such article from negotiations under this subchapter (and from any action under section 2132(c) of this title) contemplating reduction or elimination of—

  * (A) any duty on such article,

  * (B) any import restriction imposed under such section, or

  * (C) any other import restriction, the removal of which will be likely to undermine the effect of the import restrictions referred to in subparagraph (B).


* In addition, the President shall also so reserve any other article which he determines to be appropriate, taking into consideration information and advice available pursuant to and with respect to the matters covered by sections 2151, 2152, and 2153 of this title, where applicable.
