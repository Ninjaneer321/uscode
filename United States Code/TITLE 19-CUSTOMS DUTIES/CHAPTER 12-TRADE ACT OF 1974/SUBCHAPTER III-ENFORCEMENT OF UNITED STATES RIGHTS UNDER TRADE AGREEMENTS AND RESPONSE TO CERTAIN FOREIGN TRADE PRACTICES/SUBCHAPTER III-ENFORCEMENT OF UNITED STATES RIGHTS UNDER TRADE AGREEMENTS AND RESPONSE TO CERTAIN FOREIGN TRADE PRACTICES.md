### SUBCHAPTER III—ENFORCEMENT OF UNITED STATES RIGHTS UNDER TRADE AGREEMENTS AND RESPONSE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN TRADE PRACTICES

### §2411. Actions by United States Trade Representative
#### (a) Mandatory action
* (1) If the United States Trade Representative determines under section 2414(a)(1) of this title that—

  * (A) the rights of the United States under any trade agreement are being denied; or

  * (B) an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country—

    * (i) violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or

    * (ii) is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce;


* the Trade Representative shall take action authorized in subsection (c), subject to the specific direction, if any, of the President regarding any such action, and shall take all other appropriate and feasible action within the power of the President that the President may direct the Trade Representative to take under this subsection, to enforce such rights or to obtain the elimination of such act, policy, or practice. Actions may be taken that are within the power of the President with respect to trade in any goods or services, or with respect to any other area of pertinent relations with the foreign country.

* (2) The Trade Representative is not required to take action under paragraph (1) in any case in which—

  * (A) the Dispute Settlement Body (as defined in section 3531(5) of this title) has adopted a report, or a ruling issued under the formal dispute settlement proceeding provided under any other trade agreement finds, that—

    * (i) the rights of the United States under a trade agreement are not being denied, or

    * (ii) the act, policy, or practice—

      * (I) is not a violation of, or inconsistent with, the rights of the United States, or

      * (II) does not deny, nullify, or impair benefits to the United States under any trade agreement; or


  * (B) the Trade Representative finds that—

    * (i) the foreign country is taking satisfactory measures to grant the rights of the United States under a trade agreement,

    * (ii) the foreign country has—

      * (I) agreed to eliminate or phase out the act, policy, or practice, or

      * (II) agreed to an imminent solution to the burden or restriction on United States commerce that is satisfactory to the Trade Representative,


    * (iii) it is impossible for the foreign country to achieve the results described in clause (i) or (ii), as appropriate, but the foreign country agrees to provide to the United States compensatory trade benefits that are satisfactory to the Trade Representative,

    * (iv) in extraordinary cases, where the taking of action under this subsection would have an adverse impact on the United States economy substantially out of proportion to the benefits of such action, taking into account the impact of not taking such action on the credibility of the provisions of this subchapter, or

    * (v) the taking of action under this subsection would cause serious harm to the national security of the United States.


* (3) Any action taken under paragraph (1) to eliminate an act, policy, or practice shall be devised so as to affect goods or services of the foreign country in an amount that is equivalent in value to the burden or restriction being imposed by that country on United States commerce.

#### (b) Discretionary action
* If the Trade Representative determines under section 2414(a)(1) of this title that—

  * (1) an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country is unreasonable or discriminatory and burdens or restricts United States commerce, and

  * (2) action by the United States is appropriate, the Trade Representative shall take all appropriate and feasible action authorized under subsection (c), subject to the specific direction, if any, of the President regarding any such action, and all other appropriate and feasible action within the power of the President that the President may direct the Trade Representative to take under this subsection, to obtain the elimination of that act, policy, or practice. Actions may be taken that are within the power of the President with respect to trade in any goods or services, or with respect to any other area of pertinent relations with the foreign country.

#### (c) Scope of authority
* (1) For purposes of carrying out the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) or section 2416(c) of this title, the Trade Representative is authorized to—

  * (B) impose duties or other import restrictions on the goods of, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, fees or restrictions on the services of, such foreign country for such time as the Trade Representative determines appropriate;

  * (C) in a case in which the act, policy, or practice also fails to meet the eligibility criteria for receiving duty-free treatment under subsections (b) and (c) of section 2462 of this title, subsections (b) and (c) of section 2702 of this title, or subsections (c) and (d) of section 3202 of this title, withdraw, limit, or suspend such treatment under such provisions, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section; or

  * (D) enter into binding agreements with such foreign country that commit such foreign country to—

    * (i) eliminate, or phase out, the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of the action to be taken under subsection (a) or (b),

    * (ii) eliminate any burden or restriction on United States commerce resulting from such act, policy, or practice, or

    * (iii) provide the United States with compensatory trade benefits that—

      * (I) are satisfactory to the Trade Representative, and

      * (II) meet the requirements of paragraph (4).


* (2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing any service sector access authorization, and in addition to the authority conferred in paragraph (1), the Trade Representative may, for purposes of carrying out the provisions of subsection (a) or (b)—

  * (i) restrict, in the manner and to the extent the Trade Representative determines appropriate, the terms and conditions of any such authorization, or

  * (ii) deny the issuance of any such authorization.

  * (ii) a determination to initiate an investigation is made by the Trade Representative under section 2412(b) of this title.


* (C) Before the Trade Representative takes any action under this section involving the imposition of fees or other restrictions on the services of a foreign country, the Trade Representative shall, if the services involved are subject to regulation by any agency of the Federal Government or of any State, consult, as appropriate, with the head of the agency concerned.

* (3) The actions the Trade Representative is authorized to take under subsection (a) or (b) may be taken against any goods or economic sector—

  * (A) on a nondiscriminatory basis or solely against the foreign country described in such subsection, and

  * (B) without regard to whether or not such goods or economic sector were involved in the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of such action.


* (4) Any trade agreement described in paragraph (1)(D)(iii) shall provide compensatory trade benefits that benefit the economic sector which includes the domestic industry that would benefit from the elimination of the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of the action to be taken under subsection (a) or (b), or benefit the economic sector as closely related as possible to such economic sector, unless—

  * (A) the provision of such trade benefits is not feasible, or

  * (B) trade benefits that benefit any other economic sector would be more satisfactory than such trade benefits.


* (5) If the Trade Representative determines that actions to be taken under subsection (a) or (b) are to be in the form of import restrictions, the Trade Representative shall—

  * (A) give preference to the imposition of duties over the imposition of other import restrictions, and

  * (B) if an import restriction other than a duty is imposed, consider substituting, on an incremental basis, an equivalent duty for such other import restriction.
