### SUBCHAPTER III—ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RELATED ISSUES

### §3731. Sense of the Congress regarding comprehensive debt relief for the world's poorest countries
#### (a) Findings
* Congress makes the following findings:

  * (1) The burden of external debt has become a major impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many of the world's poorest countries.

  * (2) Until recently, the United States Government and other official creditors sought to address this problem by rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt reduction.

  * (3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their capacity to repay.

  * (4) In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the international community that all multilateral and bilateral creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.

  * (5) The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to address concerns raised about country conditionality, the amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation in the world's poorest countries.

#### (b) Sense of the Congress
* It is the sense of the Congress that—

  * (1) Congress and the President should work together, without undue delay and in concert with the international community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the world's poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic growth and poverty alleviation;

  * (2) this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth in beneficiary countries;

  * (3) this program of debt relief should also support the adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits are shared widely among the population, such as through initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection;

  * (4) these debt relief agreements should be designed and implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken into account;

  * (5) no country should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict or spends excessively on its military; and

  * (6) in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold.

### §3732. Executive branch initiatives
#### (a) Statement of the Congress
* The Congress recognizes that the stated policy of the executive branch in 1997, the "Partnership for Growth and Opportunity in Africa" initiative, is a step toward the establishment of a comprehensive trade and development policy for sub-Saharan Africa. It is the sense of the Congress that this Partnership is a companion to the policy goals set forth in this chapter.

#### (b) Technical assistance to promote economic reforms and development
* In addition to continuing bilateral and multilateral economic and development assistance, the President shall target technical assistance toward—

  * (1) developing relationships between United States firms and firms in sub-Saharan Africa through a variety of business associations and networks;

  * (2) providing assistance to the governments of sub-Saharan African countries to—

    * (A) liberalize trade and promote exports;

    * (B) bring their legal regimes into compliance with the standards of the World Trade Organization in conjunction with membership in that Organization;

    * (C) make financial and fiscal reforms; and

    * (D) promote greater agribusiness linkages;


  * (3) addressing such critical agricultural policy issues as market liberalization, agricultural export development, and agribusiness investment in processing and transporting agricultural commodities;

  * (4) increasing the number of reverse trade missions to growth-oriented countries in sub-Saharan Africa;

  * (5) increasing trade in services; and

  * (6) encouraging greater sub-Saharan African participation in future negotiations in the World Trade Organization on services and making further commitments in their schedules to the General Agreement on Trade in Services in order to encourage the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers.

### §3733. Overseas Private Investment Corporation initiatives
#### (a) Initiation of funds
* It is the sense of the Congress that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation should exercise the authorities it has to initiate an equity fund or equity funds in support of projects in the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in addition to the existing equity fund for sub-Saharan Africa created by the Corporation.

#### (b) Structure and types of funds
* #### (1) Structure
  * Each fund initiated under subsection (a) should be structured as a partnership managed by professional private sector fund managers and monitored on a continuing basis by the Corporation.

* #### (2) Capitalization
  * Each fund should be capitalized with a combination of private equity capital, which is not guaranteed by the Corporation, and debt for which the Corporation provides guaranties.

* #### (3) Infrastructure fund
  * One or more of the funds, with combined assets of up to $500,000,000, should be used in support of infrastructure projects in countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

* #### (4) Emphasis
  * The Corporation shall ensure that the funds are used to provide support in particular to women entrepreneurs and to innovative investments that expand opportunities for women and maximize employment opportunities for poor individuals.

#### (c) Overseas Private Investment Corporation
* #### (1) Omitted
* #### (2) Reports to Congress
  * Within 6 months after May 18, 2000, and annually for each of the 4 years thereafter, the Board of Directors of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation shall submit to Congress a report on the steps that the Board has taken to implement section 2193(e) of title 22 and any recommendations of the investment advisory council established pursuant to such section.

### §3734. Export-Import Bank initiatives
#### (a) Sense of the Congress
* It is the sense of the Congress that the Board of Directors of the Bank shall continue to take comprehensive measures, consistent with the credit standards otherwise required by law, to promote the expansion of the Bank's financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa under the loan, guarantee and insurance programs of the Bank.

#### (b) Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee
* The sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee (SAAC) is to be commended for aiding the Bank in advancing the economic partnership between the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa by doubling the number of sub-Saharan African countries in which the Bank is open for traditional financing and by increasing by tenfold the Bank's support for sales to sub-Saharan Africa from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999. The Board of Directors of the Bank and its staff shall continue to review carefully the sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee recommendations on the development and implementation of new and innovative policies and programs designed to promote the Bank's expansion in sub-Saharan Africa.

### §3735. Expansion of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress makes the following findings:

  * (1) The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (hereafter in this section referred to as the "Commercial Service") plays an important role in helping United States businesses identify export opportunities and develop reliable sources of information on commercial prospects in foreign countries.

  * (2) During the 1980s, the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals providing services in eight countries. By early 1997, that presence had been reduced by half to seven professionals in only four countries.

  * (3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to established posts.

  * (4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of coverage does not adequately service the needs of United States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan Africa.

  * (5) The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the Commercial Service to focus its resources and efforts in countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater United States export activity in those markets, and similar encouragement should be provided for countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well.

  * (6) Because market information is not widely available in many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play a significant role in assisting United States businesses in markets in those countries.

#### (b) Appointments
* Subject to the availability of appropriations, by not later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service, shall take steps to ensure that—

  * (1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and

  * (2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in not less than 10 different sub-Saharan African countries.

#### (c) Initiative for sub-Saharan Africa
* In order to encourage the export of United States goods and services to sub-Saharan African countries, the International Trade Administration shall make a special effort to—

  * (1) identify United States goods and services which are the best prospects for export by United States companies to sub-Saharan Africa;

  * (2) identify, where appropriate, tariff and nontariff barriers that are preventing or hindering sales of United States goods and services to, or the operation of United States companies in, sub-Saharan Africa;

  * (3) hold discussions with appropriate authorities in sub-Saharan Africa on the matters described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with a view to securing increased market access for United States exporters of goods and services;

  * (4) identify current resource allocations and personnel levels in sub-Saharan Africa for the Commercial Service and consider plans for the deployment of additional resources or personnel to that region; and

  * (5) make available to the public, through printed and electronic means of communication, the information derived pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4) for each of the 4 years after May 18, 2000.

### §3736. Donation of air traffic control equipment to eligible sub-Saharan African countries
* It is the sense of the Congress that, to the extent appropriate, the United States Government should make every effort to donate to governments of sub-Saharan African countries determined to be eligible under section 3703 of this title air traffic control equipment that is no longer in use, including appropriate related reimbursable technical assistance.

### §3737. Additional authorities and increased flexibility to provide assistance under the Development Fund for Africa
#### (a) Use of sustainable development assistance to support further economic growth
* It is the sense of the Congress that sustained economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon the development of a receptive environment for trade and investment, and that to achieve this objective the United States Agency for International Development should continue to support programs which help to create this environment. Investments in human resources, development, and implementation of free market policies, including policies to liberalize agricultural markets and improve food security, and the support for the rule of law and democratic governance should continue to be encouraged and enhanced on a bilateral and regional basis.

#### (b) Declarations of policy
* The Congress makes the following declarations:

  * (1) The Development Fund for Africa established under chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293 et seq.) has been an effective tool in providing development assistance to sub-Saharan Africa since 1988.

  * (2) The Development Fund for Africa will complement the other provisions of this chapter and lay a foundation for increased trade and investment opportunities between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.

  * (3) Assistance provided through the Development Fund for Africa will continue to support programs and activities that promote the long term economic development of sub-Saharan Africa, such as programs and activities relating to the following:

    * (A) Strengthening primary and vocational education systems, especially the acquisition of middle-level technical skills for operating modern private businesses and the introduction of college level business education, including the study of international business, finance, and stock exchanges.

    * (B) Strengthening health care systems.

    * (C) Supporting democratization, good governance and civil society and conflict resolution efforts.

    * (D) Increasing food security by promoting the expansion of agricultural and agriculture-based industrial production and productivity and increasing real incomes for poor individuals.

    * (E) Promoting an enabling environment for private sector-led growth through sustained economic reform, privatization programs, and market-led economic activities.

    * (F) Promoting decentralization and local participation in the development process, especially linking the rural production sectors and the industrial and market centers throughout Africa.

    * (G) Increasing the technical and managerial capacity of sub-Saharan African individuals to manage the economy of sub-Saharan Africa.

    * (H) Ensuring sustainable economic growth through environmental protection.


  * (4) The African Development Foundation has a unique congressional mandate to empower the poor to participate fully in development and to increase opportunities for gainful employment, poverty alleviation, and more equitable income distribution in sub-Saharan Africa. The African Development Foundation has worked successfully to enhance the role of women as agents of change, strengthen the informal sector with an emphasis on supporting micro and small sized enterprises, indigenous technologies, and mobilizing local financing. The African Development Foundation should develop and implement strategies for promoting participation in the socioeconomic development process of grassroots and informal sector groups such as nongovernmental organizations, cooperatives, artisans, and traders into the programs and initiatives established under this chapter.

### §3738. Assistance from United States private sector to prevent and reduce HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa
* It is the sense of the Congress that United States businesses should be encouraged to provide assistance to sub-Saharan African countries to prevent and reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. In providing such assistance, United States businesses should be encouraged to consider the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Response Fund in order to provide for coordination among such businesses in the collection and distribution of the assistance to sub-Saharan African countries.

### §3739. Sense of the Congress relating to HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds the following:

  * (1) Sustained economic development in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon successful trade with and foreign assistance to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

  * (2) The HIV/AIDS crisis has reached epidemic proportions in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 21,000,000 men, women, and children are infected with HIV.

  * (3) Eighty-three percent of the estimated 11,700,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS worldwide have been in sub-Saharan Africa.

  * (4) The HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is weakening the structure of families and societies.

  * (5)(A) The HIV/AIDS crisis threatens the future of the workforce in sub-Saharan Africa.

  * (B) Studies show that HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa most severely affects individuals between the ages of 15 and 49—the age group that provides the most support for the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.

  * (6) Clear evidence demonstrates that HIV/AIDS is destructive to the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.

  * (7) Sustained economic development is critical to creating the public and private sector resources in sub-Saharan Africa necessary to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

#### (b) Sense of the Congress
* It is the sense of the Congress that—

  * (1) addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa should be a central component of United States foreign policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa;

  * (2) significant progress needs to be made in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in order to sustain a mutually beneficial trade relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries; and

  * (3) the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is a global threat that merits further attention through greatly expanded public, private, and joint public-private efforts, and through appropriate United States legislation.

### §3740. Study on improving African agricultural practices
#### (a) In general
* The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with American Land Grant Colleges and Universities and not-for-profit international organizations, is authorized to conduct a 2-year study on ways to improve the flow of American farming techniques and practices to African farmers. The study shall include an examination of ways of improving or utilizing—

  * (1) knowledge of insect and sanitation procedures;

  * (2) modern farming and soil conservation techniques;

  * (3) modern farming equipment (including maintaining the equipment);

  * (4) marketing crop yields to prospective purchasers; and

  * (5) crop maximization practices.


* The Secretary of Agriculture shall submit the study to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives not later than September 30, 2001.

#### (b) Land Grant Colleges and not-for-profit institutions
* In conducting the study under subsection (a), the Secretary of Agriculture is encouraged to consult with American Land Grant Colleges and not-for-profit international organizations that have firsthand knowledge of current African farming practices.

### §3741. Sense of the Congress regarding efforts to combat desertification in Africa and other countries
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) desertification affects approximately one-sixth of the world's population and one-quarter of the total land area;

  * (2) over 1,000,000 hectares of Africa are affected by desertification;

  * (3) dryland degradation is an underlying cause of recurrent famine in Africa;

  * (4) the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that desertification costs the world $42,000,000,000 a year, not including incalculable costs in human suffering; and

  * (5) the United States can strengthen its partnerships throughout Africa and other countries affected by desertification, help alleviate social and economic crises caused by misuse of natural resources, and reduce dependence on foreign aid, by taking a leading role to combat desertification.

#### (b) Sense of the Congress
* It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should expeditiously work with the international community, particularly Africa and other countries affected by desertification, to—

  * (1) strengthen international cooperation to combat desertification;

  * (2) promote the development of national and regional strategies to address desertification and increase public awareness of this serious problem and its effects;

  * (3) develop and implement national action programs that identify the causes of desertification and measures to address it; and

  * (4) recognize the essential role of local governments and nongovernmental organizations in developing and implementing measures to address desertification.
