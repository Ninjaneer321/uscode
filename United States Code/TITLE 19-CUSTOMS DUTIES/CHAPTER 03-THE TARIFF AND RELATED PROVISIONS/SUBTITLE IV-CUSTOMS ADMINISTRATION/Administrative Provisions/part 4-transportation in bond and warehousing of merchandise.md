* Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, any imported distilled spirits, wines, or other liquors which may be in any customs bonded warehouse under the customs laws on the date any prohibition of their sale or removal, by any Act of Congress, or proclamation of the President of the United States takes effect shall be permitted to remain therein without payment of any taxes or duties thereon, beyond the three-year period provided by law, during such period of prohibition; and may be exported at any time during such extended period. Any imported spirits, wines, or other liquors as to which the three-year bonded period may have expired after February 24, 1919, and prior to the date such prohibition takes effect may at the option of the owner remain in bond during such period of prohibition.

Any such container of imported distilled spirits, wines, or malt liquors withdrawn from customs custody purporting to contain imported distilled spirits, wines, or malt liquors found without having thereon any mark, brand, stamp, or device the Secretary of the Treasury may require, shall be with its contents, forfeited to the United States of America.

### §469. Dealing in or using empty stamped imported liquor containers
* If any person shall purchase or sell, with the imported-liquor stamp herein required remaining thereon, or any of the marks or brands which shall have been placed thereon in accordance with the laws or regulations concerning imported liquors remaining thereon, any cask or other package, after the same has been once used to contain imported liquors and has been emptied; or if any person shall use or have in possession such cask or package, with any imitation of such marks or brands, for the purpose of placing domestic distilled spirits therein for sale; every such cask or package, with its contents, if any, shall be forfeited to the United States. And every such person who shall violate any of the provisions of this section shall be liable to a penalty of $200 for every such cask or package so purchased, sold, used, or had in possession.
