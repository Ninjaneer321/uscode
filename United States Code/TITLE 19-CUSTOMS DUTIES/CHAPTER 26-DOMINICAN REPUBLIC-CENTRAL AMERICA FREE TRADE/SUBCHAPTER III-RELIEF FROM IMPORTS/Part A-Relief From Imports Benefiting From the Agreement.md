The Commission shall transmit a copy of any petition filed under this subsection to the United States Trade Representative.

#### (b) Investigation and determination
* Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (a), the Commission, unless subsection (d) applies, shall promptly initiate an investigation to determine whether, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for under the Agreement, a CAFTA–DR article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions that imports of the CAFTA–DR article constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry producing an article that is like, or directly competitive with, the imported article.

#### (c) Applicable provisions
* The following provisions of section 2252 of this title apply with respect to any investigation initiated under subsection (b):

  * (1) Paragraphs (1)(B) and (3) of subsection (b).

  * (2) Subsection (c).

  * (3) Subsection (i).

#### (d) Articles exempt from investigation
