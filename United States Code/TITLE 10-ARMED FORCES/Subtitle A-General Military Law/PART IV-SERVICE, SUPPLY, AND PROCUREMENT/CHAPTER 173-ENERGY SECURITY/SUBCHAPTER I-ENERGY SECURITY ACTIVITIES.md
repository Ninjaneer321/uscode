* (2) The energy performance goals shall be submitted annually not later than the date on which the President submits to Congress the budget for the next fiscal year under section 1105 of title 31 and cover that fiscal year as well as the next five, l0, and 20 years. The Secretary shall identify changes to the energy performance goals since the previous submission.

* (3) The Secretary of Defense shall include the energy security and resilience goals of the Department of Defense in the installation energy report submitted under section 2925(a) of this title for fiscal year 2018 and every fiscal year thereafter. In the development of energy security and resilience goals, the Department of Defense shall conform with the definitions of energy security and resilience under this title. The report shall include the amount of critical energy load, together with the level of availability and reliability by fiscal year the Department of Defense deems necessary to achieve energy security and resilience.

* (d) ENERGY PERFORMANCE MASTER PLAN.—(1) The Secretary of Defense shall develop a comprehensive master plan for the achievement of the energy performance goals of the Department of Defense, as set forth in laws, executive orders, and Department of Defense policies.

* (2) The master plan shall include the following:

  * (A) A separate master plan, developed by each military department and Defense Agency, for the achievement of energy performance goals.

  * (B) The use of a baseline standard for the measurement of energy consumption by transportation systems, support systems, utilities, and facilities and infrastructure that is consistent for all of the military departments.

  * (C) A method of measurement of reductions or conservation in energy consumption that provides for the taking into account of changes in the current size of fleets, number of facilities, and overall square footage of facility plants.

  * (D) Metrics to track annual progress in meeting energy performance goals.

  * (E) A description of specific requirements, and proposed investments, in connection with the achievement of energy performance goals reflected in the budget of the President for each fiscal year (as submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31).

  * (F) The up-to date list of energy-efficient products maintained under section 2915(e)(2) of this title.

* (e) SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS.—For the purpose of developing and implementing the energy performance goals and energy performance master plan, the Secretary of Defense shall consider at a minimum the following:

  * (1) Opportunities to reduce the current rate of consumption of energy, the future demand for energy, and the requirement for the use of energy.

  * (2) Opportunities to enhance energy resilience to ensure the Department of Defense has the ability to prepare for and recover from energy disruptions that affect mission assurance on military installations.

  * (3) Opportunities to implement conservation measures to improve the efficient use of energy.

  * (4) Opportunities to pursue alternative energy initiatives, including the use of alternative fuels and hybrid-electric drive in military vehicles and equipment.

  * (6) Cost effectiveness, cost savings, and net present value of alternatives.

  * (7) The value of diversification of types and sources of energy used.

  * (8) The value of economies-of-scale associated with fewer energy types used.

  * (9) The value of the use of renewable energy sources.

  * (10) The value of incorporating electric, hybrid-electric, and high efficiency vehicles into vehicle fleets.

  * (11) The potential for an action to serve as an incentive for members of the armed forces and civilian personnel to reduce energy consumption or adopt an improved energy performance measure.

  * (12) Opportunities for improving energy security for facility energy projects that will use renewable energy sources.

  * (13) Opportunities to leverage financing provided by a non-Department entity to address installation energy needs.

* (C) The centralized purchasing authority shall solicit industry for the most competitive offer for replacement renewable energy certificates, to include a combination of renewable energy certificates from new projects and projects placed into service before January 1, 1999.

* (D) Subparagraph (B) does not prohibit the Secretary of a military department from entering into an agreement outside of the centralized purchasing authority if the Secretary will obtain the best value by bundling the renewable energy certificates with the facility energy project through a power purchase agreement or other contractual mechanism at the installation.

* (E) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize the purchase of renewable energy certificates to meet Federal goals or mandates in the absence of the development of a facility energy project using renewable energy sources.

* (F) This policy does not make the purchase of renewable energy certificates mandatory, but the policy shall apply whenever original renewable energy certificates are proposed to be swapped for replacement renewable energy certificates.
