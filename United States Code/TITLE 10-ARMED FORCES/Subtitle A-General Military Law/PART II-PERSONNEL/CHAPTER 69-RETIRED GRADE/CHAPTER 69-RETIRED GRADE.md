When an officer is under investigation for alleged misconduct at the time of retirement, the Secretary concerned may conditionally determine the highest grade of satisfactory service of the officer pending completion of the investigation. Such grade is subject to resolution under subsection (b)(3).

* (2)(A) In order to be eligible for voluntary retirement under any provision of this title in a grade above major or lieutenant commander, a commissioned officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps must have served on active duty in that grade for not less than three years, except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of a military department to reduce such period to a period not less than two years.

* (B) In the case of an officer to be retired in a general or flag officer grade, authority provided by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of a military department under subparagraph (A) may be exercised with respect to that officer only if approved by the Secretary of Defense or another civilian official in the Office of the Secretary of Defense appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

* (C) Authority provided by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of a military department under subparagraph (A) may be delegated within that military department only to a civilian official of that military department appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

* (D) The President may waive subparagraph (A) in individual cases involving extreme hardship or exceptional or unusual circumstances. The authority of the President under the preceding sentence may not be delegated.

* (G) Notwithstanding subparagraph (E), during fiscal years 2013 through 2025, the total number of brigadier generals and major generals of the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and the total number of rear admirals (lower half) and rear admirals of the Navy, for whom a reduction is made under this section during any fiscal year of service-in-grade otherwise required under this paragraph may not exceed 10 percent of the authorized active-duty strength for that fiscal year for officers of that armed force in those grades.

* (3) A reserve or temporary officer who is notified that he will be released from active duty without his consent and thereafter requests retirement under section 7311, 8323, or 9311 of this title and is retired pursuant to that request is considered for purposes of this section, to have been retired involuntarily. An officer retired pursuant to section 1186(b)(1) of this title is considered for purposes of this section to have been retired voluntarily.

* (b) RETIREMENT IN LOWER GRADE.—(1) An officer whose length of service in the highest grade he held while on active duty does not meet the service in grade requirements specified in subsection (a) shall be retired in the next lower grade in which he served on active duty satisfactorily, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, for not less than six months.

* (2) In the case of an officer or person whom the Secretary concerned determines committed misconduct in a lower grade, the Secretary concerned may determine the officer or person has not served satisfactorily in any grade equal to or higher than that lower grade.

* (3) A determination or certification of the retired grade of an officer shall be resolved following a conditional determination under subsection (a)(1) or (d)(1) or conditional certification under subsection (c)(4), if the investigation of or personnel action against the officer, as applicable, results in adverse findings. If the retired grade of an officer is reduced, the retired pay of the officer under chapter 71 of this title shall be recalculated, and any modification of the retired pay of the officer shall go into effect on the effective date of the reduction in retired grade.

* (c) OFFICERS IN O–9 AND O–10 GRADES.—(1) Subject to subsection (b), an officer who is serving in or has served in the grade of general or admiral or lieutenant general or vice admiral may be retired in that grade under subsection (a) only after the Secretary of Defense certifies in writing to the President and Congress that the officer served on active duty satisfactorily in that grade.

* (2) In the case of an officer covered by paragraph (1), the three-year service-in-grade requirement in paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (a) may not be reduced or waived under that subsection—

* (C) A determination referred to in subparagraph (B) is a determination that there is potentially adverse information concerning an officer and that such information has not previously been submitted to the Senate in connection with the consideration by the Senate of a nomination of that officer for an appointment for which the advice and consent of the Senate is required.

* (4) The Secretary of Defense may make a conditional certification regarding satisfactory service in grade under paragraph (1) with respect to an officer under that paragraph notwithstanding the fact that there is pending the disposition of an adverse personnel action against the officer for alleged misconduct. The retired grade of an officer following such a conditional certification is subject to resolution under subsection (b)(3).

  * (ii) because the person no longer meets the qualifications for membership in the Ready Reserve solely because of a physical disability, as determined, at a minimum, by a medical evaluation board and at the time of such transfer or discharge such person (pursuant to section 12731b of this title or otherwise) meets the service requirements established by section 12731(a) of this title for eligibility for retired pay under chapter 1223 of this title, unless the disability is described in section 12731b of this title.

* (F) A person covered by subparagraph (A) who has completed at least six months of satisfactory service in a grade above colonel or (in the case of the Navy) captain and, while serving in an active status in such grade, is involuntarily transferred (other than for cause) from active status may be credited with satisfactory service in the grade in which serving at the time of such transfer, notwithstanding failure of the person to complete three years of service in that grade.
