### §251. Federal aid for State governments
* Whenever there is an insurrection in any State against its government, the President may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature cannot be convened, call into Federal service such of the militia of the other States, in the number requested by that State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to suppress the insurrection.

### §252. Use of militia and armed forces to enforce Federal authority

### §253. Interference with State and Federal law

  * (2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.
