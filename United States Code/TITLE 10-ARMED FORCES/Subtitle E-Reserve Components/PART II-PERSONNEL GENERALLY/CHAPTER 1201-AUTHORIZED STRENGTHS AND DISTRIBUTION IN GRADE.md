### **CHAPTER 1201—AUTHORIZED STRENGTHS AND DISTRIBUTION IN GRADE**

### §12001. Authorized strengths: reserve components
* (a) Whenever the authorized strength of a reserve component (other than the Coast Guard Reserve) is not prescribed by law, it shall be prescribed by the President.

* (b) Subject to the authorized strength of the reserve component concerned, the authorized strength of each reserve component (other than the Coast Guard Reserve) in members in each grade is that which the Secretary concerned determines to be necessary to provide for mobilization requirements. The Secretary shall review these determinations at least once each year and revise them if he considers it necessary. However, a member of the reserve component concerned may not, as a result of such a determination, be reduced in the member's reserve grade without the member's consent.

### §12002. Authorized strengths: Army and Air Force reserve components, exclusive of members on active duty
* (a) The authorized strengths of the National Guard and the reserve components of the Army and the Air Force, exclusive of members who are included in the strengths authorized for members of the Army and Air Force, respectively, on active duty, are as follows:

### §12003. Authorized strengths: commissioned officers in an active status
* (a) The authorized strengths of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps in reserve commissioned officers, other than commissioned warrant officers and officers on an active-duty list, in an active status are as follows:

A vacancy in any grade may be filled by an authorized appointment in any lower grade.

* (2) A strength prescribed by the Secretary concerned under paragraph (1) for a grade may not be higher than the percentage of the strength authorized for the Army or the Air Force, as the case may be, under section 12003 of this title that is specified for that grade as follows:

* (2) When the actual number of line officers in an active status in any grade is less than the number authorized by paragraph (1) for that grade, the difference may be applied to increase the number authorized by that paragraph for any lower grade or grades.

* (c)(1) The authorized strengths of the Marine Corps Reserve in officers in an active status in the grades of colonel, lieutenant colonel, major, and captain, and in the grades of first lieutenant and second lieutenant combined, are the following percentages of the total authorized number of those officers:

  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
  | --- | --- |
  | Colonel | 2 percent&nbsp;&nbsp; |
  | Lieutenant colonel | 8 percent&nbsp;&nbsp; |

* (2) When the actual number of officers in an active status in any grade is less than the number authorized by paragraph (1) for that grade, the difference may be applied to increase the number authorized by that paragraph for any lower grade or grades.

* (d)(1) An officer of the Army or Air Force may not be reduced in grade because of a reduction in the number of commissioned officers authorized for the officer's grade under this section.

* (2) An officer of the Navy Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve may not be reduced in permanent grade because of a reduction in the number authorized by this section for his grade.

### §12006. Strength limitations: authority to waive in time of war or national emergency
* (a) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of section 12003, 12004, or 12005 of this title. So long as any such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President.

* (b) Any suspension under subsection (a) shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621, 1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of termination of the emergency.

### §12007. Reserve officers of the Army: distribution
* The Secretary of the Army shall distribute the number of reserve commissioned officers, other than commissioned warrant officers, authorized in each commissioned grade between those assigned to reserve units organized to serve as units and those not assigned to such units. The Secretary shall distribute the number who are assigned to reserve units organized to serve as units among the units of each reserve component by prescribing appropriate tables of organization and tables of distribution. The Secretary shall distribute the number who are not assigned to such units between—

  * (1) each special branch; and

  * (2) all other branches taken together.

### §12008. Army Reserve and Air Force Reserve: warrant officers
* The Secretary of the Army may prescribe the authorized strength of the Army Reserve in warrant officers. The Secretary of the Air Force may prescribe the authorized strength of the Air Force Reserve in warrant officers.

### §12009. Army and Air Force reserve components: temporary increases

* (b) An authorized strength so increased is increased for no other purpose. While an officer holds that grade, the officer whose appointment caused the increase is counted for the purpose of determining when other appointments, not under those sections, may be made in that grade.

### §12010. Computations for Navy Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve: rule when fraction occurs in final result
* When there is a fraction in the final result of any computation under this chapter for the Navy Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve, a fraction of one-half or more is counted as one, and a fraction of less than one-half is disregarded.

### §12011. Authorized strengths: reserve officers on active duty or on full-time National Guard duty for administration of the reserves or the National Guard

* (b) DETERMINATIONS BY INTERPOLATION.—If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is between any two consecutive numbers in the first column of the appropriate table in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), the corresponding authorized strengths for each of the grades shown in that table for that component are determined by mathematical interpolation between the respective numbers of the two strengths. If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is more or less than the highest or lowest number, respectively, set forth in the first column of the appropriate table in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall fix the corresponding strengths for the grades shown in that table at the same proportion as is reflected in the nearest limit shown in the table.

* (c) REALLOCATIONS TO LOWER GRADES.—Whenever the number of officers serving in any grade for duty described in subsection (a) is less than the number authorized for that grade under this section, the difference between the two numbers may be applied to increase the number authorized under this section for any lower grade.

* (d) SECRETARIAL WAIVER.—(1) Upon determining that it is in the national interest to do so, the Secretary of Defense may increase for a particular fiscal year the number of reserve officers that may be on full-time reserve component duty for a reserve component in a grade referred to in a table in subsection (a) by a number that does not exceed the number equal to 5 percent of the maximum number specified for the grade in that table.

* (2) Whenever the Secretary exercises the authority provided in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives notice in writing of the adjustment made.

* (e) FULL-TIME RESERVE COMPONENT DUTY DEFINED.—In this section, the term "full-time reserve component duty" means the following duty:

  * (1) Active duty described in sections 10211, 10302, 10303, 10304, 10305, 12310, or 12402 of this title.

  * (2) Full-time National Guard duty (other than for training) under section 502(f) of title 32, except for duty under section 115(b)(1)(B) and (C) of this title and section 115(i)(9) of this title.

* (b) DETERMINATIONS BY INTERPOLATION.—If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is between any two consecutive numbers in the first column of the table in subsection (a), the corresponding authorized strengths for each of the grades shown in that table for that component are determined by mathematical interpolation between the respective numbers of the two strengths. If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is more or less than the highest or lowest number, respectively, set forth in the first column of the table in subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall fix the corresponding strengths for the grades shown in the table at the same proportion as is reflected in the nearest limit shown in the table.

* (c) REALLOCATIONS TO LOWER GRADE.—Whenever the number of members serving in pay grade E–9 for duty described in subsection (a) is less than the number authorized for that grade under this section, the difference between the two numbers may be applied to increase the number authorized under this section for pay grade E–8.

* (d) SECRETARIAL WAIVER.—(1) Upon determining that it is in the national interest to do so, the Secretary of Defense may increase for a particular fiscal year the number of reserve enlisted members that may be on active duty or full-time National Guard duty as described in subsection (a) for a reserve component in a pay grade referred to in a table in subsection (a) by a number that does not exceed the number equal to 5 percent of the maximum number specified for that grade and reserve component in the table.

* (2) Whenever the Secretary exercises the authority provided in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives notice in writing of the adjustment made.

* (e) FULL-TIME RESERVE COMPONENT DUTY DEFINED.—In this section, the term "full-time reserve component duty" has the meaning given the term in section 12011(e) of this title.
