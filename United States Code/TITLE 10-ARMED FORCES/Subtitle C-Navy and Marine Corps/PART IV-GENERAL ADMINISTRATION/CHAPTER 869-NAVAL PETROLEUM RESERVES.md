* (a) The Secretary, directly or by contract, lease, or otherwise, shall explore, prospect, conserve, develop, use, and operate the naval petroleum reserves in his discretion, subject to the provisions of subsection (c) and the other provisions of this chapter; except that no petroleum leases shall be granted at Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1 and 3.

* (b) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, particularly subsection (c), the naval petroleum reserves shall be used and operated for—

  * (1) the protection, conservation, maintenance, and testing of those reserves; or

  * (2) the production of petroleum whenever and to the extent that the Secretary, with the approval of the President, finds that such production is needed for national defense purposes and the production is authorized by a joint resolution of Congress.


* (c)(1) In administering Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1, 2, and 3, the Secretary is authorized and directed—

  * (A) to further explore, develop, and operate such reserves;

  * (B) to produce, during any extension of a period under paragraph (2), such reserves—

    * (i) at the maximum efficient rate consistent with sound engineering practices; or

    * (ii) at a lesser rate consistent with sound engineering practices and the protection, conservation, maintenance, and testing of such reserves if the Secretary determines that the minimum price described in section 8730(b)(2) of this title cannot be attained for the United States share of petroleum (other than natural gas liquids) produced from such Reserves;


  * (C) during such production period or any extension thereof to sell or otherwise dispose of the United States share of such petroleum produced from such reserves as provided in section 8730 of this title; and

  * (D) to construct, acquire, or contract for the use of storage and shipping facilities on and off the reserves and pipelines and associated facilities on and off the reserves for transporting petroleum from such reserves to the points where the production from such reserves will be refined or shipped.


* Any pipeline in the vicinity of a naval petroleum reserve not otherwise operated as a common carrier may be acquired by the Secretary by condemnation, if necessary, if the owner thereof refuses to accept, convey, and transport without discrimination and at reasonable rates any petroleum produced at such reserve. With the approval of the Secretary, rights-of-way for new pipelines and associated facilities may be acquired by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the appropriate United States district court. Such rights-of-way may be acquired in the manner set forth in sections 3114–3116 and 3118 of title 40, and the prospective holder of the right-of-way is "the authority empowered by law to acquire the land" within the meaning of those sections. Such new pipelines shall accept, convey, and transport without discrimination and at reasonable rates any petroleum produced at such reserves as a common carrier.

* (2) After April 5, 1982, the President may extend the period of production in the case of any naval petroleum reserve for additional periods of not to exceed three years each—

  * (A) after the President requires an investigation to be made, in the case of each extension, to determine the necessity for continued production from such naval petroleum reserve;

  * (B) after the President submits to the Congress, at least 180 days before the expiration of the current production period prescribed by this section, or any extension thereof, a copy of the report made to him on such investigation together with a certification by him that continued production from such naval petroleum reserve is in the national interest; and

  * (C) if neither House of Congress within ninety days after receipt of such report and certification adopts a resolution disapproving further production from such naval petroleum reserve.

### §8723. Periodic re-examination of production requirements
* The Secretary shall from time to time reexamine the need for the production of petroleum from oil shale for national defense when that production is authorized under section 8722 of this title. If he finds that the authorized quantity is no longer needed, he shall reduce production to the amount currently needed for national defense.

### §8724. Protection of oil reserves; contracts for conservation
* (a) To consolidate and protect the oil lands owned by the United States, the Secretary may—

  * (1) contract with owners and lessees of land inside or adjoining naval petroleum reserves for—

  * (1) by purchase, inside the naval petroleum reserves, or outside those reserves on the same geologic structure; and

  * (2) by condemnation, inside Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1, or, if there is substantial drainage, outside that reserve on the same geologic structure.


* (b) The Secretary shall report annually to Congress all proceedings for purchase and condemnation under this section.

### §8727. Cooperative or unit plans in the naval petroleum reserves
* The Secretary, with the consent of the President, may make agreements, with respect to lands inside the naval petroleum reserves, of the same type as the Secretary of the Interior may make under section 17(m) of the Act of February 25, 1920 (30 U.S.C. 226(m)). No such agreement made by the Secretary may extend the term of any lease unless the agreement so provides.

### §8728. Agreements and leases: provision for change
* Every unit or cooperative plan of development and operation and every lease affecting lands owned by the United States within Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 2 and the oil shale reserves shall contain a provision authorizing the Secretary, subject to approval by the President and to any limitation in the plan or lease, to change from time to time the rate of prospecting and development on, and the quantity and rate of production from, lands of the United States under the plan or lease, notwithstanding any other provision of law.

### §8729. Re-lease of certain lands: lessee's preferential right
* The Secretary, on terms prescribed by him, may re-lease lands in the naval petroleum reserves that were covered by leases made before July 1, 1936, and terminated by law at the expiration of their initial twenty-year periods. If any such land is to be re-leased, the Secretary shall give to the former lessee preferential rights to the new lease.

### §8730. Disposition of products
* (a) In administering the naval petroleum reserves under this chapter, the Secretary shall use, store, or sell the petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves and lands covered by joint, unit, or other cooperative plans.

* (b)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, each sale of the United States share of petroleum shall be made by the Secretary at public sale to the highest qualified bidder, at such time, in such amounts, and after such advertising as the Secretary considers proper and without regard to Federal, State, or local regulations controlling sales or allocation of petroleum products. Each sale of the United States share of petroleum shall be for periods of not more than one year, except that a sale of natural gas may be made for a period of more than one year.

* (2) The Secretary may not sell any part of the United States share of petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 2 and 3 at a price less than the current sales price, as estimated by the Secretary, of comparable petroleum in the same area.

* (3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term "petroleum" does not include natural gas liquids.

* (c) In no event shall the Secretary permit the award of any contract which would result in any person obtaining control, directly or indirectly, over more than 20 percent of the estimated annual United States share of petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1.

* (d) Each proposal for sale under this title shall provide that the terms of every sale of the United States share of petroleum from the naval petroleum reserves shall be so structured as to give full and equal opportunity for the acquisition of petroleum by all interested persons, including major and independent oil producers and refiners alike. When the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, determines that the public interests will be served by the sale of petroleum to small refiners not having their own adequate sources of supply of petroleum, the Secretary is authorized and directed to set aside a portion of the United States share of petroleum produced for sale to such refiners under the provisions of this section for processing or use in such refineries, except that—

  * (1) none of the production sold to small refiners may be resold in kind;

  * (2) production must be sold at a cost of not less than the prevailing local market price of comparable petroleum;

  * (3) the set-aside portion may not exceed 25 percent of the estimated annual United States share of the total production from all producing naval petroleum reserves; and

  * (4) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), the Secretary may, at his discretion if he deems it to be in the public interest, prorate such petroleum among such refiners for sale, without competition, at not less than the prevailing local market price of comparable petroleum.


* (e) Any petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves, except such petroleum which is either exchanged in similar quantities for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation with persons or the government of an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an adjacent foreign state and reenters the United States, shall be subject to all of the limitations and licensing requirements of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.) and, in addition, before any petroleum subject to this section may be exported under the limitations and licensing requirement and penalty and enforcement provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, the President must make and publish an express finding that such exports will not diminish the total quality or quantity of petroleum available to the United States and that such exports are in the national interest and are in accord with the Export Administration Act of 1979.

* (f) During the period of production or any extension thereof authorized by section 8722(c) of this title, the consultation and approval requirements of section 8731(a)(3) of this title are waived.

* (g)(1) Prior to the promulgation of any rules and regulations, plans of development and amendments thereto, and in the entering and making of contracts and operating agreements relating to the development, production, or sale of petroleum in or from the reserves, the Secretary shall consult with and give due consideration to the views of the Attorney General of the United States with respect to matters which may affect competition.

* (2) No contract or operating agreement may be made, issued, or executed under this chapter until at least 15 days after the Secretary notifies the Attorney General of the proposed contract or operating agreement. Such notification shall contain such information as the Attorney General may require in order to advise the Secretary as to whether such contract or operating agreement may create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. If, within such 15-day period, the Attorney General advises the Secretary that a contract or operating agreement may create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws, then the Secretary may not make, issue, or execute that contract or operating agreement.

* (h) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to confer on any person immunity from civil or criminal liability, or to create defenses to actions, under the antitrust laws.

  * (5) sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act of June 19, 1936 (commonly referred to as the "Robinson-Patman Act") (15 U.S.C. 13a, 13b, and 21a).


* (j) Any pipeline which accepts, conveys, or transports any petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1 or Numbered 3 shall accept, convey, and transport without discrimination and at reasonable rates any such petroleum as a common carrier insofar as petroleum from such reserves is concerned. Every contract entered into by the Secretary for the sale of any petroleum owned by the United States which is produced from such reserves shall contain provisions implementing the requirements of the preceding sentence if the contractor owns a controlling interest in any pipeline or any company operating any pipeline, or is the operator of any pipeline, which carries any petroleum produced from such naval petroleum reserves. The Secretary may promulgate rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section and he, or the Secretary of the Interior where the authority extends to him, may declare forfeit any contract, operating agreement, right-of-way, permit, or easement held by any person violating any such rule or regulation. This section shall not apply to any natural gas common carrier pipeline operated by any person subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.) or any public utility subject to regulation by a State or municipal regulatory agency having jurisdiction to regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers within the State or municipality.

* (k)(1) With respect to all or any part of the United States share of petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves, the President may direct that the Secretary—

  * (A) place that petroleum in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as authorized by sections 151 through 166 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6231–6246); or

  * (B) exchange, directly or indirectly, that petroleum for other petroleum to be placed in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under such terms and conditions and by such methods as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, without regard to otherwise applicable Federal procurement statutes and regulations.


* (2) The requirements of section 159 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6239) do not apply to actions taken under this subsection.

* (l)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter (but subject to paragraph (2)), during any period in which the production of petroleum is authorized from Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1, 2, or 3, the Secretary, at the request of the Secretary of Defense, may provide any portion of the United States share of petroleum so produced to the Department of Defense for its use, exchange, or sale in order to meet petroleum product requirements of the Department of Defense.

* (2) Petroleum may be provided to the Department of Defense under paragraph (1) either directly or by such exchange as the Secretary deems appropriate. Appropriate reimbursement reasonably reflecting the fair market value shall be provided by the Secretary of Defense for petroleum provided under this subsection.

* (3) Any exchange made pursuant to this subsection may be made without regard to otherwise applicable Federal procurement statutes and regulations.

* (4) Paragraph (1) does not apply to any petroleum set aside for small refiners under subsection (d) or placed in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under subsection (k).
