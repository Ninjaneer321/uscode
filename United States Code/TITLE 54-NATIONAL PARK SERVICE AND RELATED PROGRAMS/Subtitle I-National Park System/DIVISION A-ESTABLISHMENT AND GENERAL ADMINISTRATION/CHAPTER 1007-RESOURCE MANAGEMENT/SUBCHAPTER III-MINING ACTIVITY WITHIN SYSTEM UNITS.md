### SUBCHAPTER III—MINING ACTIVITY WITHIN SYSTEM UNITS

### §100731. Findings and declaration
* Congress finds and declares that—

  * (1) the level of technology of mineral exploration and development has changed radically, and continued application of the mining laws of the United States to System units to which the mining laws apply conflicts with the purposes for which the System units were established; and

  * (2) all mining operations in System units should be conducted so as to prevent or minimize damage to the environment and other resource values.

### §100732. Preservation and management of System units by Secretary; promulgation of regulations
* To preserve for the benefit of present and future generations the pristine beauty of System units, and to further the purposes of section 100101(a), chapter 1003, and sections 100751(a), 100752, 100753, and 102101 of this title and the individual organic Acts for the System units, all activities resulting from the exercise of mineral rights on patented or unpatented mining claims within any System unit shall be subject to such regulations prescribed by the Secretary as the Secretary considers necessary or desirable for the preservation and management of the System units.

### §100733. Recordation of mining claims; publication of notice
* All mining claims under the Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. chapter 2, sections 161 and 162, and chapters 12A and 16) that lie within the boundaries of System units in existence on September 28, 1976, that were not recorded with the Secretary within one year after September 28, 1976, shall be conclusively presumed to be abandoned and shall be void. The recordation does not render valid any claim that was not valid on September 28, 1976, or that becomes invalid after that date.

### §100734. Report on finding or notification of potential damage to natural and historical landmarks
* When the Secretary finds on the Secretary's own motion or on being notified in writing by an appropriate scientific, historical, or archeological authority that a district, site, building, structure, or object that has been found to be nationally significant in illustrating natural history or the history of the United States and that has been designated as a natural or historic landmark may be irreparably lost or destroyed in whole or in part by any surface mining activity, including exploration for or removal or production of minerals or materials, the Secretary shall notify the person conducting the activity and submit a report on the findings or notification, including the basis for the Secretary's finding that the activity may cause irreparable loss or destruction of a national landmark, to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, with a request for advice of the Council as to alternative measures that may be taken by the United States to mitigate or abate the activity.

### §100735. Civil actions for just compensation by mining claim holders
* The holder of any patented or unpatented mining claim subject to this subchapter that believes the holder has suffered a loss by operation of this subchapter, or by orders or regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, may bring a civil action in United States district court to recover just compensation, which shall be awarded if the court finds that the loss constitutes a taking of property compensable under the Constitution.

### §100736. Acquisition of land by Secretary
* Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to acquire land and interests in land within the boundary of any System unit. The Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by the owner of any valid right or other property in Glacier Bay National Monument, Death Valley National Monument, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, or Mount McKinley National Park to sell the right or other property if the owner notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership of the right or property is causing, or would result in, undue hardship.

### §100737. Financial disclosure by officer or employee of Secretary
* (a) WRITTEN STATEMENTS.—Each officer or employee of the Secretary who—

  * (1) performs any function or duty under this subchapter, or any Act amended by the Mining in the Parks Act (Public Law 94–429, 90 Stat. 1342) concerning the regulation of mining in the System; and

  * (2) has any known financial interest—

    * (A) in any person subject to this subchapter or any Act amended by the Mining in the Parks Act (Public Law 94–429, 90 Stat. 1342); or

    * (B) in any person who holds a mining claim within the boundary of any System unit;


* shall annually file with the Secretary a written statement concerning all such interests held by the officer or employee during the preceding calendar year. The statement shall be available to the public.

* (b) MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.—The Secretary shall—

  * (1) define the term "known financial interest" for purposes of subsection (a);

  * (3) submit to Congress on June 1 of each year a report with respect to the disclosures and the actions taken in regard to the disclosures during the preceding calendar year.


* (c) EXEMPTIONS.—In the rules prescribed under subsection (b), the Secretary may identify specific positions within the Department of the Interior that are of a nonregulatory or nonpolicymaking nature and provide that officers or employees occupying those positions shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.

* (d) CRIMINAL PENALTIES.—Criminal penalties for a violation of this section are provided by section 1865 of title 18.
