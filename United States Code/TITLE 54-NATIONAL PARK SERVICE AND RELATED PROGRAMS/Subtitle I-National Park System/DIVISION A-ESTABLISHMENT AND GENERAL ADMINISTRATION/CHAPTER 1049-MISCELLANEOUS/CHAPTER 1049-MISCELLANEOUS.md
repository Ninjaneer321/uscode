### §104906. Protection of right of individuals to bear arms
* (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

  * (1) The 2d amendment to the Constitution provides that "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed".

  * (2) Section 2.4(a)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that "except as otherwise provided in this section and parts 7 (special regulations) and 13 (Alaska regulations), the following are prohibited: (i) Possessing a weapon, trap or net (ii) Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) Using a weapon, trap or net".

  * (3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent individuals complying with Federal and State laws from exercising the 2d amendment rights of the individuals while at System units.

  * (4) The existence of different laws relating to the transportation and possession of firearms at different System units entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at System units.

    * (A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction with respect to the implementation and enforcement of the new regulations; and

    * (B) the new regulations—

      * (i) are under review by the Obama administration; and

      * (ii) may be altered.


  * (6) Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again override the 2d amendment rights of law-abiding citizens on 83,600,000 acres of System land.

  * (7) Federal laws should make it clear that the 2d amendment rights of an individual at a System unit should not be infringed.
