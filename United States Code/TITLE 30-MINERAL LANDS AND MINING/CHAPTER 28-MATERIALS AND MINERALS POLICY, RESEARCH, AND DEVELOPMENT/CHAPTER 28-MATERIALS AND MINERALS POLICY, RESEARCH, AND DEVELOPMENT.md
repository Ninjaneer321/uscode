### **CHAPTER 28—MATERIALS AND MINERALS POLICY, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT**

### §1601. Congressional statement of findings; "materials" defined
* (a) The Congress finds that—

  * (1) the availability of materials is essential for national security, economic well-being, and industrial production;

  * (2) the availability of materials is affected by the stability of foreign sources of essential industrial materials, instability of materials markets, international competition and demand for materials, the need for energy and materials conservation, and the enhancement of environmental quality;

  * (3) extraction, production, processing, use, recycling, and disposal of materials are closely linked with national concerns for energy and the environment;

  * (4) the United States is strongly interdependent with other nations through international trade in materials and other products;

  * (5) technological innovation and research and development are important factors which contribute to the availability and use of materials;

  * (6) the United States lacks a coherent national materials policy and a coordinated program to assure the availability of materials critical for national economic well-being, national defense, and industrial production, including interstate commerce and foreign trade; and

  * (7) notwithstanding the enactment of section 21a of this title, the United States does not have a coherent national materials and minerals policy.


* (b) As used in this chapter, the term "materials" means substances, including minerals, of current or potential use that will be needed to supply the industrial, military, and essential civilian needs of the United States in the production of goods or services, including those which are primarily imported or for which there is a prospect of shortages or uncertain supply, or which present opportunities in terms of new physical properties, use, recycling, disposal or substitution, with the exclusion of food and of energy fuels used as such.

### §1602. Congressional declaration of policies
* The Congress declares that it is the continuing policy of the United States to promote an adequate and stable supply of materials necessary to maintain national security, economic well-being and industrial production with appropriate attention to a long-term balance between resource production, energy use, a healthy environment, natural resources conservation, and social needs. The Congress further declares that implementation of this policy requires that the President shall, through the Executive Office of the President, coordinate the responsible departments and agencies to, among other measures—

  * (1) identify materials needs and assist in the pursuit of measures that would assure the availability of materials critical to commerce, the economy, and national security;

  * (2) establish a mechanism for the coordination and evaluation of Federal materials programs, including those involving research and development so as to complement related efforts by the private sector as well as other domestic and international agencies and organizations;

  * (3) establish a long-range assessment capability concerning materials demands, supply and needs, and provide for the policies and programs necessary to meet those needs;

  * (4) promote a vigorous, comprehensive, and coordinated program of materials research and development consistent with the policies and priorities set forth in the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.);

  * (5) promote cooperative research and development programs with other nations for the equitable and frugal use of materials and energy;

  * (6) promote and encourage private enterprise in the development of economically sound and stable domestic materials industries; and

  * (7) encourage Federal agencies to facilitate availability and development of domestic resources to meet critical materials needs.

### §1603. Implementation of policies
* For the purpose of implementing the policies set forth in section 1602 of this title and the provisions of section 1604 of this title, the Congress declares that the President shall, through the Executive Office of the President, coordinate the responsible departments and agencies, and shall—

  * (1) direct that the responsible departments and agencies identify, assist, and make recommendations for carrying out appropriate policies and programs to ensure adequate, stable, and economical materials supplies essential to national security, economic well-being, and industrial production;

  * (2) support basic and applied research and development to provide for, among other objectives—

    * (A) advanced science and technology for the exploration, discovery, and recovery of nonfuel materials;

    * (B) enhanced methods or processes for the more efficient production and use of renewable and nonrenewable resources;

    * (C) improved methods for the extraction, processing, use, recovery, and recycling of materials which encourage the conservation of materials, energy, and the environment; and

    * (D) improved understanding of current and new materials performance, processing, substitution, and adaptability in engineering designs;


  * (3) provide for improved collection, analysis, and dissemination of scientific, technical and economic materials information and data from Federal, State, and local governments and other sources as appropriate;

  * (4) assess the need for and make recommendations concerning the availability and adequacy of supply of technically trained personnel necessary for materials research, development, extraction, harvest and industrial practice, paying particular regard to the problem of attracting and maintaining high quality materials professionals in the Federal service;

  * (5) establish early warning systems for materials supply problems;

  * (6) recommend to the Congress appropriate measures to promote industrial innovation in materials and materials technologies;

  * (7) encourage cooperative materials research and problem-solving by—

    * (A) private corporations performing the same or related activities in materials industries; and

    * (B) Federal and State institutions having shared interests or objectives;


  * (8) assess Federal policies which adversely or positively affect all stages of the materials cycle, from exploration to final product recycling and disposal including but not limited to, financial assistance and tax policies for recycled and virgin sources of materials and make recommendations for equalizing any existing imbalances, or removing any impediments, which may be created by the application of Federal law and regulations to the market for materials; and

  * (9) assess the opportunities for the United States to promote cooperative multilateral and bilateral agreements for materials development in foreign nations for the purpose of increasing the reliability of materials supplies to the Nation.
