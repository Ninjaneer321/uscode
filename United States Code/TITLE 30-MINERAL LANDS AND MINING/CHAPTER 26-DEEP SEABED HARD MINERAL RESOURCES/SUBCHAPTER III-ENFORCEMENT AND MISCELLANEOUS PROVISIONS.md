The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $25,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator by written notice.

The Administrator shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which the particular violation was found and such penalty was imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings and order of the Administrator shall be set aside by such court if they are not found to be supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2)(E) of title 5.

In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.

#### (d) Compromise or other action by the Administrator
