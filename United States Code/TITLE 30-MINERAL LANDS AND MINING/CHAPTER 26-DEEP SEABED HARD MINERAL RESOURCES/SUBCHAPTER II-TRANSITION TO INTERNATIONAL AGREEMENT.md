### SUBCHAPTER II—TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT

### §1441. Declaration of Congressional intent
* It is the intent of Congress—

  * (1) that any international agreement to which the United States becomes a party should, in addition to promoting other national oceans objectives—

    * (A) provide assured and nondiscriminatory access, under reasonable terms and conditions, to the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed for United States citizens, and

    * (B) provide security of tenure by recognizing the rights of United States citizens who have undertaken exploration or commercial recovery under subchapter I before such agreement enters into force with respect to the United States to continue their operations under terms, conditions, and restrictions which do not impose significant new economic burdens upon such citizens with respect to such operations with the effect of preventing the continuation of such operations on a viable economic basis;


  * (2) that the extent to which any such international agreement conforms to the provisions of paragraph (1) should be determined by the totality of the provisions of such agreement, including, but not limited to, the practical implications for the security of investments of any discretionary powers granted to an international regulatory body, the structures and decisionmaking procedures of such body, the availability of impartial and effective procedures for the settlement of disputes, and any features that tend to discriminate against exploration and commercial recovery activities undertaken by United States citizens; and

  * (3) that this chapter should be transitional pending—

    * (A) the adoption of an international agreement at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, and the entering into force of such agreement, or portions thereof, with respect to the United States, or

    * (B) if such adoption is not forthcoming, the negotiation of a multilateral or other treaty concerning the deep seabed, and the entering into force of such treaty with respect to the United States.

### §1442. Effect of international agreement
* If an international agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, any provision of subchapter I, this subchapter, or subchapter III, and any regulation issued under any such provision, which is not inconsistent with such international agreement shall continue in effect with respect to United States citizens. In the implementation of such international agreement the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall make every effort, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the provisions of that agreement, to provide for the continued operation of exploration and commercial recovery activities undertaken by United States citizens prior to entry into force of the agreement. The Administrator shall submit to the Congress, within one year after the date of such entry into force, a report on the actions taken by the Administrator under this section, which report shall include, but not be limited to—

  * (1) a description of the status of deep seabed mining operations of United States citizens under the international agreement; and

  * (2) an assessment of whether United States citizens who were engaged in exploration or commercial recovery on the date such agreement entered into force have been permitted to continue their operations.

### §1443. Protection of interim investments
* In order to further the objectives set forth in section 1441 of this title, the Administrator, not more than one year after June 28, 1980—

  * (1) shall submit to the Congress proposed legislation necessary for the United States to implement a system for the protection of interim investments that has been adopted as part of an international agreement and any resolution relating to such international agreement; or

  * (2) if a system for the protection of interim investments has not been so adopted, shall report to the Congress on the status of negotiations relating to the establishment of such a system.

### §1444. Disclaimer of obligation to pay compensation
* Sections 1441 and 1442 of this title do not create or express any legal or moral obligation on the part of the United States Government to compensate any person for any impairment of the value of that person's investment in any operation for exploration or commercial recovery under subchapter I which might occur in connection with the entering into force of an international agreement with respect to the United States.
