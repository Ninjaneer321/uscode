  * (1) in accordance with requirements established by the Office of Personnel Management, with respect to standards for career reserved positions, and

  * (2) after consultation with the Office, with respect to standards for general positions.


* (b) Not more than 30 percent of the Senior Executive Service positions authorized under section 3133 of this title may at any time be filled by individuals who did not have 5 years of current continuous service in the civil service immediately preceding their initial appointment to the Senior Executive Service, unless the President certifies to the Congress that the limitation would hinder the efficiency of the Government. In applying the preceding sentence, any break in service of 3 days or less shall be disregarded.

Such provisions shall apply in lieu of the provisions which would otherwise apply—

  * (A) to the extent provided under regulations prescribed by the Office, and

  * (B) so long as the appointee continues to serve under such Presidential appointment.

  * (A) which is not in the Senior Executive Service; and

  * (B) which is covered by the Executive Schedule, or the rate of basic pay for which is fixed by statute at a rate equal to 1 of the levels of the Executive Schedule.
