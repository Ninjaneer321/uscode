This subsection does not apply—

  * (1) if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session of the Senate;

### §5504. Biweekly pay periods; computation of pay
* (a) The pay period for an employee covers two administrative workweeks.

* (b) When, in the case of an employee, it is necessary for computation of pay under this subsection to convert an annual rate of basic pay to a basic hourly, daily, weekly, or biweekly rate, the following rules govern:

  * (1) To derive an hourly rate, divide the annual rate by 2,087.

  * (2) To derive a daily rate, multiply the hourly rate by the number of daily hours of service required.

  * (3) To derive a weekly or biweekly rate, multiply the hourly rate by 40 or 80, as the case may be.


* Rates are computed to the nearest cent, counting one-half and over as a whole cent.

* (c) For the purposes of this section:

  * (1) The term "employee" means—

    * (A) an employee in or under an Executive agency;

    * (B) an employee in or under the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Botanic Garden, and the Library of Congress, for whom a basic administrative workweek is established under section 6101(a)(5) of this title; and

  * (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), an individual who otherwise would be excluded from the definition of employee shall be deemed to be an employee for purposes of this section if the individual's employing agency so elects, under guidelines in regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management under subsection (d)(2).


* (d)(1) The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe regulations, subject to the approval of the President, necessary for the administration of this section insofar as this section affects employees in or under an Executive agency.

  * (1) A month's pay is one-twelfth of a year's pay.

  * (2) A day's pay is one-thirtieth of a month's pay.

  * (3) The 31st day of a calendar month is ignored in computing pay, except that one day's pay is forfeited for one day's unauthorized absence on the 31st day of a calendar month.

  * (4) For each day of the month elapsing before entering the service, one day's pay is deducted from the first month's pay of the individual.


* This section does not apply to an employee whose pay is computed under section 5504(b) of this title.

### §5506. Computation of extra pay based on standard or daylight saving time
* When an employee as defined by section 2105 of this title or an individual employed by the government of the District of Columbia is entitled to extra pay for services performed between or after certain named hours of the day or night, the extra pay is computed on the basis of either standard or daylight saving time, depending on the time observed by law, custom, or practice where the services are performed.
