  * (4) An education allowance or payment of travel costs to assist an employee with the extraordinary and necessary expenses, not otherwise compensated for, incurred because of his service in a foreign area or foreign areas in providing adequate education for his dependents (or, to the extent education away from post is involved, official assignment to service in such area or areas), as follows:

    * (A) An allowance not to exceed the cost of obtaining such kindergarten, elementary and secondary educational services as are ordinarily provided without charge by the public schools in the United States (including such educational services as are provided by the States under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), plus, in those cases when adequate schools are not available at the post of the employee, board and room, and periodic transportation between that post and the school chosen by the employee, not to exceed the total cost to the Government of the dependent attending an adequate school in the nearest United States locality where an adequate school is available, without regard to section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31.

    * (C) In those cases in which an adequate school is available at the post of the employee, if the employee chooses to educate the dependent at a school away from post, the education allowance which includes board and room, and periodic travel between the post and the school chosen, shall not exceed the total cost to the Government of the dependent attending an adequate school at the post of the employee.

    * (D) Allowances provided pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) may include, at the election of the employee, payment or reimbursement of the costs incurred to store baggage for the employee's dependent at or in the vicinity of the dependent's school during one trip per year by the dependent between the school and the employee's duty station, except that such payment or reimbursement may not exceed the cost that the Government would incur to transport the baggage in connection with the trip, and such payment or reimbursement shall be in lieu of transportation of the baggage.

### §5925. Post differentials
* (a) A post differential may be granted on the basis of conditions of environment which differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States and warrant additional pay as a recruitment and retention incentive. A post differential may be granted to an employee officially stationed in the United States who is on extended detail in a foreign area. A post differential under this subsection may not exceed 35 percent of the rate of basic pay.

* (b) Any employee granted a differential under subsection (a) of this section may be granted an additional differential for an assignment to a post determined to have especially adverse conditions of environment which warrant additional pay as a recruitment and retention incentive for the filling of positions at that post. An additional differential for any employee under this subsection—

  * (1) may be paid for each assignment to a post determined to have such conditions;

  * (2) may be paid periodically or in a lump sum; and

  * (3) may not exceed 15 percent of the rate of basic pay of that employee for the period served under that assignment.

### §5926. Compensatory time off at certain posts in foreign areas
* (a) Under regulations prescribed pursuant to this subchapter, and notwithstanding subchapter V of chapter 55 of this title or any other law, the head of an agency may, on request of an employee serving in a foreign area—

  * (1) at an isolated post performing functions required to be maintained on a substantially continuous basis, grant the employee compensatory time off for an equal amount of time spent in regularly scheduled overtime work; or

  * (2) at a post in a locality that customarily observes irregular hours of work or where other special conditions are present, in order to cope with those special circumstances, grant the employee compensatory time off for an equal amount of time spent in regularly scheduled overtime work for use during the pay period in which it is earned.


* Credit for compensatory time off earned under paragraph (2) shall not form the basis for any additional compensation.

* (b) Compensatory time earned under this section shall be for use only while the employee is assigned to the post where it is earned. Any such compensatory time not used at the time the employee is reassigned to another post shall be forfeited.

### §5927. Advances of pay
* (a) Up to three months' pay may be paid in advance—

  * (1) to an employee upon the assignment of the employee to a post in a foreign area;

  * (2) to an employee, other than an employee appointed under section 303 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (and employed under section 311 of such Act), who—

    * (A) is a citizen of the United States;

    * (B) is officially stationed or located outside the United States pursuant to Government authorization; and

    * (C) requires (or has a family member who requires) medical treatment outside the United States, in circumstances specified by the President in regulations; and


  * (3) to an employee compensated pursuant to section 408 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, who—

    * (A) pursuant to United States Government authorization is located outside the country of employment; and

    * (B) requires medical treatment outside the country of employment in circumstances specified by the President in regulations.

### §5928. Danger pay allowance
* An employee serving in a foreign area may be granted a danger pay allowance on the basis of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions which threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. A danger pay allowance may not exceed 35 percent of the basic pay of the employee, except that if an employee is granted an additional differential under section 5925(b) of this title with respect to an assignment, the sum of that additional differential and any danger pay allowance granted to the employee with respect to that assignment may not exceed 35 percent of the basic pay of the employee. The presence of nonessential personnel or dependents shall not preclude payment of an allowance under this section. In each instance where an allowance under this section is initiated or terminated, the Secretary of State shall inform the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate of the action taken and the circumstances justifying it.
