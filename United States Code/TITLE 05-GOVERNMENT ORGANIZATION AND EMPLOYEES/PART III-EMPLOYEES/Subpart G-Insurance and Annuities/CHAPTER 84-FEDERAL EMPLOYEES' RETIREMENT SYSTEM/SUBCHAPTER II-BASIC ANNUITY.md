    * (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in line of duty during a period of war as defined by section 1101 of title 38; or

  * (A) shall be allowed credit for such service without regard to the deposit requirement under paragraph (1)(B); and

  * (B) shall be entitled, upon filing appropriate application therefor with the Office, to a refund equal to the difference between—

    * (i) the amount deposited with respect to such period under such section 8334(j) (or prior provision), excluding interest; and

    * (ii) the amount which would otherwise have been required with respect to such period under paragraph (1)(B).

  * (ii) whose death occurs before separation from the service,


* creditable service of the deceased employee or Member shall include each period of military service includable under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) or under paragraph (3). In carrying out this subparagraph, any amount deposited under section 8422(e)(5) shall be taken into account.

* (B) A survivor annuity computed based on an amount which, under authority of subparagraph (A), takes into consideration any period of military service shall be reduced by the amount of any survivor's benefits—

The amount deducted and withheld under this paragraph shall be paid to that former spouse. The period of civil service employment by the employee or Member shall not be taken into consideration in determining the amount of the deductions and withholding or the amount of the payment to the former spouse. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph.

* (d) Credit under this chapter shall be allowed for leaves of absence without pay granted an employee while performing military service, or while receiving benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81. An employee or former employee who returns to duty after a period of separation is deemed, for the purpose of this subsection, to have been on leave of absence without pay for that part of the period in which that individual was receiving benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81. Credit may not be allowed for so much of other leaves of absence without pay as exceeds 6 months in the aggregate in a calendar year.

* (e) Credit shall be allowed for periods of approved leave without pay granted an employee to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of employees (as defined by section 8331(1) or 8401(11)), subject to the employee arranging to pay, through the employee's employing agency, within 60 days after commencement of such leave without pay, amounts equal to the retirement deductions and agency contributions which would be applicable under sections 8422(a) and 8423(a), respectively, if the employee were in pay status. If the election and all payments provided by this subsection are not made, the employee may not receive credit for the periods of leave without pay, notwithstanding the third sentence of subsection (d).

* (f)(1) An employee or Member who has received a refund of retirement deductions under subchapter III of chapter 83 with respect to any service described in subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) may not be allowed credit for such service under this chapter unless such employee or Member deposits an amount equal to 1.3 percent of basic pay for such service, with interest. A deposit under this paragraph may be made only with respect to a refund received pursuant to an application filed with the Office before the date on which the employee or Member first becomes subject to this chapter.

* (2) An employee or Member may not be allowed credit under this chapter for any service described in subsection (b)(3) for which retirement deductions under subchapter III of chapter 83 have not been made, unless such employee or Member deposits an amount equal to 1.3 percent of basic pay for such service, with interest.

* (3) Interest under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be computed in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 8334(e) and regulations prescribed by the Office.

  * (2) transferred without a break in service to a position to which the employee was appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and in which position the employee is subject to this subchapter,


* shall be treated for all purposes of this subchapter as if any service that would have been creditable under the retirement system established under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act was service performed while subject to this subchapter if any employee and employer deductions, contributions or rights with respect to the employee's service are transferred from such retirement system to the Fund.

* (h) An employee or Member shall be allowed credit for service as a volunteer or volunteer leader under part A of title VIII of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as a full-time volunteer enrolled in a program of at least 1 year's duration under part A, B, or C of title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, or as a volunteer or volunteer leader under the Peace Corps Act performed at any time prior to the separation on which the entitlement to any annuity under this subchapter is based if the employee or Member has made a deposit with interest, if any, with respect to such service under section 8422(f).

* (i) For purposes of subsection (b)(5), the term "Bank Plan" means the benefit structure in which employees of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System appointed on or after January 1, 1984, participate, which benefit structure is a component of the Retirement Plan for Employees of the Federal Reserve System, established under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act (and any redesignated or successor version of such benefit structure, if so identified in writing by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for purposes of this chapter).

* (i)(1) Upon application to the Office of Personnel Management, any individual who was an employee on the date of enactment of this paragraph, and who has on such date or thereafter acquired 5 years or more of creditable civilian service under this section (exclusive of service for which credit is allowed under this subsection) shall be allowed credit (as service as a congressional employee) for service before December 31, 1990, while employed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Congressional Committee, or the Republican National Congressional Committee, if—

* (b) The annuity of a Member, or former Member with title to a Member annuity, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Member or Congressional employee, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.

* (c) The annuity of a Congressional employee, or former Congressional employee, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Congressional employee or Member, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.

* (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the annuity of an individual described in subsection (b) or (c) who is a revised annuity employee or a further revised annuity employee shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual described in subsection (a).

  * (A) the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and

  * (B) the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee's actual service, as determined by prorating the employee's total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.


* (2) For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.

* (3) If the condition under paragraph (2) is met, then, any amounts received by the individual in the form of a physicians comparability allowance shall (for the purposes referred to in paragraph (2)) be treated as basic pay, but only to the extent that such amounts are attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, and only to the extent of the percentage allowable, which shall be determined as follows:

  | **If the total amount of service &nbsp;performed, on or after the date of &nbsp;the enactment of this subsection, &nbsp;as a Government physician is:** | **Then, the percentage allowable is:** |
  | --- | --- |
  | Less than 2 years | 0&nbsp;&nbsp; |

  * (1) on the basis of service that does not include service credited under section 8411(b)(6); and

  * (2) assuming the employee separated from service on the actual date of the separation of the employee.


* The amount of the reduction shall be computed under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management for the administration of this subsection.

* (m)(1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires from the position of a registered nurse with the Veterans Health Administration on an immediate annuity, or dies while employed in that position leaving any survivor entitled to an annuity, includes the days of unused sick leave to the credit of that employee under a formal leave system, except that such days shall not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter.

  * (ii) the costs associated with providing for the election under this subsection.


* The amount to be deposited under clause (i) shall include interest, computed at the rate of 6 percent a year.

    * (ii) would cause the total of survivor annuities payable under sections 8442 and 8445, respectively, based on the service of the employee or Member to exceed the amount which would be payable to a widow or widower of such employee or Member under such section 8442 (determined without regard to any reduction to provide for an annuity under such section 8445); and

    * (B) payment of an annuity to the employee or Member for life, with a survivor annuity payable for the life of a surviving spouse.


* (c) Each alternative provided for under subsection (b) shall, to the extent practicable, be designed such that the present value of the benefits provided under such alternative (including any lump-sum credit) is actuarially equivalent to the sum of—

  * (1) the present value of the annuity which would otherwise be provided under this subchapter, as computed under section 8415; and

  * (2) the present value of the annuity supplement which would otherwise be provided (if any) under section 8421.


* (d) An employee or Member who, at the time of retiring under this subchapter—

  * (1) is married, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section unless a waiver is made under section 8416(a); or

  * (2) has a former spouse, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section if the former spouse is entitled to benefits under section 8445 or 8467 (based on the service of the employee or Member) under the terms of a decree of divorce or annulment, or a court order or court-approved property settlement incident to any such decree, with respect to which the Office has been duly notified.


* (e) An employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this subchapter and who makes an election under this section may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of retirement, make the election provided for under section 8416(d), subject to the deposit requirement thereunder.

### §8421. Annuity supplement
* (a)(1) Subject to paragraph (3), an individual shall, if and while entitled to an annuity under subsection (a), (b), (d), or (e) of section 8412, or under section 8414(c), also be entitled to an annuity supplement under this section.

* (2) Subject to paragraph (3), an individual shall, if and while entitled to an annuity under section 8412(f), or under subsection (a) or (b) of section 8414, also be entitled to an annuity supplement under this section if such individual is at least the applicable minimum retirement age under section 8412(h).

* (3)(A) An individual whose entitlement to an annuity under section 8412 or 8414 does not commence before age 62 is not entitled to an annuity supplement under this section.

* (B) An individual entitled to an annuity supplement under this section ceases to be so entitled after the last day of the month preceding the first month for which such individual would, on proper application, be entitled to old-age insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, but not later than the last day of the month in which such individual attains age 62.

* (b)(1) The amount of the annuity supplement of an annuitant under this section for any month shall be equal to the product of—

  * (A) an amount determined under paragraph (2), multiplied by

  * (B) a fraction, as described in paragraph (3).


* (2) The amount under this paragraph for an annuitant is an amount equal to the old-age insurance benefit which would be payable to such annuitant under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to sections 203, 215(a)(7), and 215(d)(5) of such Act) upon attaining age 62 and filing application therefor, determined as if the annuitant had attained such age and filed application therefor, and were a fully insured individual (as defined in section 214(a) of such Act), on January 1 of the year in which such annuitant's entitlement to any payment under this section commences, except that the reduction of such old-age insurance benefit under section 202(q) of such Act shall be the maximum applicable for an individual born in the same year as the annuitant. In computing the primary insurance amount under section 215 of such Act for purposes of this paragraph, the number of elapsed years (referred to in section 215(b)(2)(B)(iii) of such Act and used to compute the number of benefit computation years) shall not include years beginning with the year in which such annuitant's entitlement to any payment under this section commences, and—

  * (A) only basic pay for service performed (if any) shall be taken into account in computing the total wages and self-employment income of the annuitant for a benefit computation year;

  * (B) for a benefit computation year which commences after the date of the separation with respect to which entitlement to the annuitant's annuity under this subchapter is based and before the date as of which such annuitant is treated, under the preceding sentence, to have attained age 62, the total wages and self-employment income of such annuitant for such year shall be deemed to be zero; and

  * (C) for a benefit computation year after age 21 which precedes the separation referred to in subparagraph (B), and during which the individual did not perform a full year of service, the total wages and self-employment income of such annuitant for such year shall be deemed to have been an amount equal to the product of—

    * (i) the average total wages of all workers for that year, multiplied by

    * (ii) a fraction—

      * (I) the numerator of which is the total basic pay of the individual for service performed in the first year thereafter in which such individual performed a full year of service; and

      * (II) the denominator of which is the average total wages of all workers for the year referred to in subclause (I).


* (3) The fraction under this paragraph for any annuitant is a fraction—

  * (A) the numerator of which is the annuitant's total years of service (rounding a fraction to the nearest whole number, with ½ being rounded to the next higher number), not to exceed the number under subparagraph (B); and

  * (B) the denominator of which is 40.


* (4) For the purpose of this subsection—

  * (A) the term "benefit computation year" has the meaning provided in section 215(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act;

  * (B) the term "average total wages of all workers", for a year, means the average of the total wages, as defined and computed under section 215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Social Security Act for such year; and

  * (C) the term "service" does not include military service.


* (c) An amount under this section shall, for purposes of section 8467, be treated in the same way as an amount computed under section 8415.

### §8421a. Reductions on account of earnings from work performed while entitled to an annuity supplement
* (a) Except as provided in subsection (c), the amount of the annuity supplement to which an individual is entitled under section 8421 for any month (determined without regard to subsection (c) of such section) shall be reduced by the amount of any excess earnings of such individual which are required to be charged to such supplement for such month, as determined under subsection (b).

* (b) The amount of an individual's excess earnings shall be charged to months as follows:

  * (1)(A) There shall be charged to each month of a year under subsection (a) an amount equal to the individual's excess earnings (as determined under paragraph (2) with respect to such year), divided by the number of the individual's supplement entitlement months for such year (as determined under paragraph (3)).

  * (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount charged to a month under subsection (a) may not exceed the amount of the annuity supplement to which the individual is entitled under section 8421 for such month (determined without regard to subsection (c) of such section).

  * (2) The excess earnings based on which reductions under subsection (a) shall be made with respect to an individual in a year—

    * (A) shall be equal to 50 percent of so much of such individual's earnings for the immediately preceding year as exceeds the applicable exempt amount for such preceding year; but

    * (B) may not exceed the total amount of the annuity supplement payments to which such individual was entitled for such preceding year under section 8421 (determined without regard to subsection (c) of such section, and without regard to this section).


  * (3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the number of an individual's supplement entitlement months for a year shall be 12.

  * (B) The number determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced so as not to include any month after which such individual ceases to be entitled to an annuity supplement by reason of section 8421(a)(3)(B), relating to cessation of entitlement upon attaining age 62.

  * (4)(A) For purposes of this section, and except as provided in subparagraph (B), the "earnings" and the "applicable exempt amount" of an individual shall be determined in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of section 203 of the Social Security Act.

  * (B) For purposes of this section—

    * (i) in determining the excess earnings of any individual, only earnings attributable to periods during which such individual was entitled to an annuity supplement under section 8421 shall be considered; and

    * (ii) any earnings attributable to a period before attaining the applicable retirement age under section 8412(h) shall not be considered in determining the excess earnings of an individual who retires under section 8412(d) or (e), or section 8414(c).


  * (5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (4), the reduction required by subsection (a) shall be effective with respect to the annuity supplement payable for each month in the 12-month period beginning on the first day of the seventh month after the end of the calendar year in which the excess earnings were earned.


* (c) This section shall not apply to an individual described in section 8412(e) during any period in which the individual, after separating from the service as described in that section, is employed as an air traffic control instructor, or supervisor thereof, under contract with the Federal Aviation Administration, including an instructor or supervisor working at an on-site facility (such as an airport).

* (d) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which this section shall be applied in the case of a reemployed annuitant.
