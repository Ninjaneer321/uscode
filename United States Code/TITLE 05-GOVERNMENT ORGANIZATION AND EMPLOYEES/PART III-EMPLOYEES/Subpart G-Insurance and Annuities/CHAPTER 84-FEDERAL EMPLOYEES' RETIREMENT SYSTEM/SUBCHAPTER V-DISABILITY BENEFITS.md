### SUBCHAPTER V—DISABILITY BENEFITS

### §8451. Disability retirement
* (a)(1)(A) An employee who completes at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under section 8411 and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency.

* (B) For purposes of this subsection, an employee shall be considered disabled only if the employee is found by the Office to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position.

* (2)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee shall not be eligible for disability retirement under this section if the employee has declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in the employee's agency for which the employee is qualified if the position—

  * (i) is at the same grade (or pay level) as the employee's most recent grade (or pay level) or higher;

  * (ii) is within the employee's commuting area; and

  * (iii) is one in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.


* (B) An employee who is applying for disability retirement under this subchapter shall be considered for reassignment by the employee's agency to a vacant position described in subparagraph (A) in accordance with such procedures as the Office shall by regulation prescribe.

* (C) An employee is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701 any determination that the employee is not unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in a position to which the employee has declined reassignment under this section.

* (D) For purposes of subparagraph (A), an employee of the United States Postal Service shall not be considered qualified for a position if such position is in a different craft or if reassignment to such position would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement covering the employee.

* (b) A Member who completes at least 18 months of service as a Member and is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a Member because of disease or injury shall be retired on the Member's own application.

### §8452. Computation of disability annuity
* (a)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), or subsection (b), (c), or (d), the annuity of an annuitant under this subchapter—

  * (i) for the period beginning on the date on which such annuity commences, or is restored (as described in section 8455(b)(2) or (3)), and ending at the end of the twelfth month beginning on or after such date, shall be equal to 60 percent of the annuitant's average pay; and

  * (ii) after the end of the period referred to in clause (i), shall be equal to 40 percent of the annuitant's average pay.


* (B) An annuity computed under this paragraph—

  * (i) shall not, during any period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), be adjusted under section 8462; but

  * (ii) shall, after the end of any period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), be adjusted to reflect all adjustments made under section 8462(b) after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), whether the amount actually payable to the annuitant under this section in any month is determined under this subsection or otherwise.


* (2)(A) For any month in which an annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter as computed under paragraph (1) and to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the Social Security Act, the annuitant's annuity for such month (as so computed) shall—

  * (i) if such month occurs during a period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i), be reduced by 100 percent of the annuitant's assumed disability insurance benefit for such month; or

  * (ii) if such month occurs other than during a period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i), be reduced by 60 percent of the annuitant's assumed disability insurance benefit for such month;


* except that an annuity may not be reduced below zero by reason of this paragraph.

* (B)(i) For purposes of this paragraph, the assumed disability insurance benefit of an annuitant for any month shall be equal to—

  * (I) the amount of the disability insurance benefit to which the annuitant is entitled under section 223 of the Social Security Act for the month in which the annuity under this subchapter commences, or is restored, or, if no entitlement to such disability insurance benefits exists for such month, the first month thereafter for which the annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter and disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act, adjusted by

  * (II) all adjustments made under section 8462(b) after the end of the period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i) (or, if later, after the end of the month preceding the first month for which the annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter and disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act) and before the start of the month involved (without regard to whether the annuitant's annuity was affected by any of those adjustments).


* (ii) For purposes of applying section 224 of the Social Security Act to the assumed disability insurance benefit used to compute the reduction under this paragraph, the amount of the annuity under this subchapter which is considered shall be the amount of the annuity as determined before the application of this paragraph.

* (3) Section 8462 shall apply with respect to amounts under this subsection only as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2).

* (b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (d), if an annuitant is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter as of the day before the date of the sixty-second anniversary of the annuitant's birth (hereinafter in this section referred to as the annuitant's "redetermination date"), such annuity shall be redetermined by the Office in accordance with paragraph (2). Effective as of the annuitant's redetermination date, the annuity (as so redetermined) shall be in lieu of any annuity to which such annuitant would otherwise be entitled under this subchapter.

* (2)(A) An annuity redetermined under this subsection shall be equal to the amount of the annuity to which the annuitant would be entitled under section 8415, taking into account the provisions of subparagraph (B).

* (B) In performing a computation under this paragraph—

  * (i) creditable service of an annuitant shall be increased by including any period (or periods) before the annuitant's redetermination date during which the annuitant was entitled to an annuity under this subchapter; and

  * (ii) the average pay which would otherwise be used shall be adjusted to reflect all adjustments made under section 8462(b) with respect to any period (or periods) referred to in clause (i) (without regard to whether the annuitant's annuity was affected by any of those adjustments).


* (c) Except as provided in subsection (d), the annuity of an annuitant under this subchapter shall be computed under section 8415 if—

  * (1) such annuity commences, or is restored, beginning on or after the redetermination date of the annuitant; or

  * (2) as of the day on which such annuity commences, or is restored, the annuitant satisfies the age and service requirements for entitlement to an annuity under section 8412 (other than subsection (g) of such section).


* (d)(1) The annuity to which an annuitant is entitled under this section (after the reduction under subsection (a)(2), if applicable, has been made) shall not be less than the amount of an annuity computed under section 8415 (excluding subsection (h) of such section).

* (2) In applying this subsection with respect to any annuitant, the amount of an annuity so computed under section 8415 shall be adjusted under section 8462 (including subsection (c) thereof)—

  * (A) to the same extent, and otherwise in the same manner, as if it were an annuity—

    * (i) subject to adjustment under such section; and

    * (ii) with a commencement date coinciding with the date the annuitant's annuity commenced or was restored under this subchapter, as the case may be; and


  * (B) whether the amount actually payable to the annuitant under this section in any month is determined under this subsection or otherwise.

### §8453. Application
* A claim may be allowed under this subchapter only if application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who, at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter, is mentally incompetent if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.

### §8454. Medical examination
* An annuitant receiving a disability retirement annuity from the Fund shall be examined under the direction of the Office—

  * (1) at the end of 1 year from the date of the disability retirement; and

  * (2) annually thereafter until becoming 60 years of age;


* unless the disability is permanent in character. If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required by this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily established.

### §8455. Recovery; restoration of earning capacity
* (a)(1) If an annuitant receiving a disability retirement annuity from the Fund recovers from the disability before becoming 60 years of age, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 1 year after the date on which the Office determines that the annuitant has recovered, whichever is earlier.

* (2) If an annuitant receiving a disability annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored. Earning capacity is deemed restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.

* (b)(1) If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (a) is not reemployed in a position in which that individual is subject to this chapter, such individual is deemed, except for service credit, to have been involuntarily separated from the service for the purpose of subchapter II of this chapter as of the date of termination of the disability annuity, and after that termination is entitled to annuity under the applicable provisions of such subchapter.

* (2) If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (a)(2)—

  * (A) is not reemployed in a position subject to this chapter; and

  * (B) has not recovered from the disability for which that individual was retired;


* the annuity of such individual shall be restored at the applicable rate under section 8452 effective the first of the year following any calendar year in which such individual's income from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.

* (3) If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of a medical finding that the individual has recovered from disability is not reemployed in a position in which such individual is subject to this chapter, the annuity of such individual shall be restored at the applicable rate under section 8452 effective from the date on which the Office determines that there has been a recurrence of the disability.

* (4) Paragraphs (2) and (3) shall not apply in the case of an annuitant receiving an annuity from the Fund under subchapter II of this chapter.

### §8456. Military reserve technicians
* (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), an individual shall be retired under this subchapter if the individual—

  * (A) is separated from employment as a military reserve technician by reason of a disability that disqualifies the individual from membership in a reserve component of the Armed Forces specified in section 10101 of title 10 or from holding the military grade required for such employment;

  * (B) is not considered to be disabled under section 8451(a)(1)(B);

  * (C) is not appointed to a position in the Government (whether under subsection (b) or otherwise); and

  * (D) has not declined an offer of an appointment to a position in the Government under subsection (b).


* (2) Payment of any annuity for an individual pursuant to this section terminates—

  * (A) on the date the individual is appointed to a position in the Government (whether pursuant to subsection (b) or otherwise);

  * (B) on the date the individual declines an offer of appointment to a position in the Government under subsection (b); or

  * (C) as provided under section 8455(a).


* (3) An individual eligible to retire under section 8414(c) shall not be eligible to retire under this section.

* (b) Any individual applying for or receiving any annuity pursuant to this section shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office, be considered by any agency of the Government before any vacant position in the agency is filled if—

  * (1) the position is located within the commuting area of the individual's former position;

  * (2) the individual is qualified to serve in such position, as determined by the head of the agency; and

  * (3) the position is at the same grade or equivalent level as the position from which the individual was separated.
