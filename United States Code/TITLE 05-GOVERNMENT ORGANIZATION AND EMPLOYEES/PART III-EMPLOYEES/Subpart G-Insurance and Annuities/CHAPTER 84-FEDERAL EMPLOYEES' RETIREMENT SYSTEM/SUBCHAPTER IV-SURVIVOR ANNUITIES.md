* (2) In the case of a widow or widower whose annuity under this section is terminated because of remarriage before becoming 55 years of age, the annuity shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the day the remarriage is dissolved by death, divorce, or annulment, if—

  * (B) the amount determined under paragraph (3).


* (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount under this paragraph for a survivor is the amount of widow's or widower's insurance benefits which would be payable to such survivor under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to sections 202(e)(7), 202(f)(2), and 203 of such Act) based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant, and determined—

  * (i) as of the date on which the annuitant died; and

  * (ii) as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made application for those benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of such Act, as the case may be.


* (B) Any computation or determination under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Social Security Act, except that in computing any primary insurance amount under section 215 of such Act for purposes of determining an amount under this subsection, subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 8421(b)(2) shall apply.

  * (B) shall not be payable to a survivor who would not be entitled to benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of the Social Security Act based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant (determined, as of the date of the annuitant's death, as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made appropriate application for benefits, but without regard to any restriction under either such subsection relating to remarriage); and

  * (C) shall not be payable to a survivor for any calendar month in which such survivor is entitled (or would, on proper application, be entitled) to benefits under section 202(g) of the Social Security Act (relating to mother's and father's insurance benefits), or under section 202(e) or (f) of such Act by reason of having become disabled, based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant.


* (5) For the purpose of this subsection, the term "assumed CSRS annuity", as used in the case of a survivor, means the amount of the annuity to which such survivor would be entitled under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title based on the service of the deceased annuitant, determined—

  * (A) as of the day after the date of the annuitant's death;

  * (B) as if the survivor had made appropriate application therefor; and

  * (C) as if the service of the deceased annuitant were creditable under such subchapter.


* (6) An amount payable under this subsection shall be adjusted under section 8462 and shall otherwise be treated under this chapter in the same way as an amount payable under subsection (a).

* (g)(1) If the widow or widower of an annuitant under section 8452 (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a "disability annuitant") is determined under subsection (a) to be entitled to an annuity based on the service of such disability annuitant, the annuity of the widow or widower shall be equal to 50 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (2) (or one-half thereof if designated for this purpose under section 8419 of this title), rather than of the amount referred to in subsection (a).

* (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount on which the annuity of the widow or widower of a disability annuitant is based shall be the amount of the annuity to which such disability annuitant was entitled, as computed under section 8452 (including appropriate reduction under subsection (a)(2) of such section and any adjustments under section 8462 allowed under section 8452), as of the day before the date of the disability annuitant's death.

* (B)(i) In the case of a widow or widower entitled to an annuity based on the service of a disability annuitant who dies before age 62, the amount under clause (ii) shall apply instead of the amount which would otherwise apply under subparagraph (A).

* (ii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), the amount of the annuity to which the disability annuitant was entitled as of the day before the date of death shall be considered to be the amount which would be computed with respect to such disability annuitant under section 8452(b) if the disability annuitant had attained age 62 on the day before date of death.

* (II) For purposes of any such computation under section 8452(b)(2) pursuant to this clause, creditable service shall (in addition to the service which would otherwise be used under subparagraph (B)(i) of such section) include the period of time between date of death and the date of the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the annuitant, and average pay shall be adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii) of such section only through date of death.

* (h) The following rules shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this section:

  * (1) The annuity payable under this section to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between—

    * (A) the amount of the annuity which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this section; and

    * (B) the amount of the annuity payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election made under section 8417(b) or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in section 8445(a).


  * (2) The amount payable under subsection (b)(1)(A) to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between—

    * (A) the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under such subsection; and

### §8443. Rights of a child
* (a)(1) If an employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service which is creditable under section 8411, or an annuitant dies, each surviving child is, for any month, entitled to an annuity equal to—

  * (A) the amount by which the applicable amount under paragraph (2) for such month exceeds the applicable amount under paragraph (3) for such month, divided by

  * (B) the number of children entitled to a payment under this section for such month.


* (2) The applicable amount under this paragraph for any month is the total amount to which the surviving child or children (as the case may be) of the annuitant, employee, or Member would be entitled for such month under subchapter III of chapter 83 (including any adjustment based on section 8340) based on the service of such annuitant, employee, or Member, if the service of such annuitant, employee, or Member were creditable under such subchapter.

* (3) The applicable amount under this paragraph for any month is the total amount of child's insurance benefits which are payable (or would, on proper application, be payable) under title II of the Social Security Act for such month based on the wages and self-employment income of such annuitant, employee, or Member.

* (b) The annuity of a child under this subchapter—

  * (1) commences on the day after the annuitant, employee, or Member dies;

  * (2) commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes a student as described by section 8441(4), if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund; or

  * (3) commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability incurred before age 18 (or a later recurrence of such disability), if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund.


* This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child—

  * (A) becomes 18 years of age unless then a student as described or incapable of self-support;

  * (B) becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless then such a student;

  * (C) becomes 22 years of age if then such a student and capable of self-support;

  * (D) ceases to be such a student after becoming 18 years of age unless then incapable of self-support; or

On the death of the surviving wife or husband, or former wife or husband, or termination of the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or children shall be recomputed and paid as though the wife or husband, former wife or husband, or child had not survived the annuitant, employee, or Member. If the annuity of a child under this subchapter terminates under subparagraph (E) because of marriage, then, if such marriage ends, such annuity shall resume on the first day of the month in which it ends, but only if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund, and that individual is not otherwise ineligible for such annuity.

### §8444. Rights of a named individual with an insurable interest

* (b)(1) The annuity payable to a former spouse under this section may not exceed the difference between—

  * (A) the amount applicable in the case of such former spouse, as determined under paragraph (2); and

  * (B) the amount of any annuity payable under this section to any other former spouse of the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election previously made under section 8417(b), or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in subsection (a).


* (2) The applicable amount, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A) in the case of a former spouse, is the amount of the annuity which would be payable under the provisions of section 8442 (including subsection (f) of such section, but without regard to subsection (h) of such section) if such former spouse were a widow or widower entitled to an annuity under such provisions based on the service of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member.

* (c) The commencement and termination of an annuity payable under this section shall be governed by the terms of the applicable order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, except that any such annuity—

    * (B) the first day of the second month beginning after the date on which the Office receives written notice of the order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, together with such additional information or documentation as the Office may prescribe;


* whichever is later; and

  * (2) except as provided in subsection (h), shall terminate no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age or dies.


* (d) For purposes of this chapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in subsection (a) shall not be effective—

  * (1) if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, concerned; and

  * (2) to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this section.


* (e) For purposes of this chapter, a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in subsection (a) shall not be effective, in the case of a former spouse, to the extent that it is inconsistent with any joint waiver previously executed with respect to such former spouse under section 8416(a).

* (f)(1) Any amount under section 8442(b)(1)(A) which would otherwise be payable to a widow or widower based on the service of another individual shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Office to a former spouse of such individual if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or the terms of a court order or court-approved property settlement incident to any decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation.

* (2) Paragraph (1) shall apply only to payments made by the Office after the date of receipt in the Office of written notice of such decree, order, or agreement, and such additional information and documentation as the Office may prescribe.
