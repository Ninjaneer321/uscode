### §8521. Definitions; application
* (a) For the purpose of this subchapter—

    * (A) the individual was discharged or released under honorable conditions (and, if an officer, did not resign for the good of the service); and

    * (B)(i) the individual was discharged or released after completing his first full term of active service which the individual initially agreed to serve, or

    * (ii) the individual was discharged or released before completing such term of active service—

      * (I) for the convenience of the Government under an early release program,

      * (II) because of medical disqualification, pregnancy, parenthood, or any service-incurred injury or disability,

      * (III) because of hardship (including pursuant to a sole survivorship discharge, as that term is defined in section 1174(i) of title 10), or

The Secretary of Labor shall issue, from time to time, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, schedules specifying the pay and allowances for each pay grade of servicemen covered by this subchapter, which reflect representative amounts for appropriate elements of the pay and allowances whether in cash or in kind; and

### §8522. Assignment of Federal service and wages
* Notwithstanding section 8504 of this title, Federal service and Federal wages not previously assigned shall be assigned to the State in which the claimant first files claim for unemployment compensation after his latest discharge or release from Federal service.
