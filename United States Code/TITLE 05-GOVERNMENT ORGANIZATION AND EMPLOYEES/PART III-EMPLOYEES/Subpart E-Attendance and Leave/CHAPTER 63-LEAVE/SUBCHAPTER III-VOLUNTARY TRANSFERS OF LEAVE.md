### §6332. General authority
* Notwithstanding any provision of subchapter I, and subject to the provisions of this subchapter, the Office of Personnel Management shall establish a program under which annual leave accrued or accumulated by an employee may be transferred to the annual leave account of any other employee if such other employee requires additional leave because of a medical emergency.

### §6333. Receipt and use of transferred leave
* (a)(1) An application to receive donations of leave under this subchapter, whether submitted by or on behalf of an employee—

  * (A) shall be submitted to the employing agency of the proposed leave recipient; and

  * (B) shall include—

    * (i) the name, position title, and grade or pay level of the proposed leave recipient;

    * (ii) the reasons why transferred leave is needed, including a brief description of the nature, severity, anticipated duration, and, if it is a recurring one, the approximate frequency of the medical emergency involved;

    * (iii) if the employing agency so requires, certification from 1 or more physicians, or other appropriate experts, with respect to any matter under clause (ii); and

    * (iv) any other information which the employing agency may reasonably require.


* (2) If an agency requires that an employee obtain certification under paragraph (1)(B)(iii) from 2 or more sources, the agency shall ensure, either by direct payment to the expert involved or by reimbursement, that the employee is not required to pay for the expenses associated with obtaining certification from more than 1 of such sources.

* (3) An employing agency shall approve or disapprove an application of a proposed leave recipient for leave under this subchapter, and, to the extent practicable, shall notify the proposed leave recipient (or other person acting on behalf of the proposed recipient, if appropriate) of the decision of the agency, in writing, within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receiving such application.

* (b)(1) A leave recipient may use annual leave received under this subchapter in the same manner and for the same purposes as if such leave recipient had accrued that leave under section 6303, except that any annual leave, and any sick leave, accrued or accumulated by the leave recipient and available for the purpose involved must be exhausted before any transferred annual leave may be used.

* (2)(A) The requirement under paragraph (1) relating to exhaustion of annual and sick leave shall not apply in the case of a leave recipient who—

  * (i) sustains a combat-related disability while a member of the armed forces, including a reserve component of the armed forces; and

  * (ii) is undergoing medical treatment for that disability.


* (B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply to a member described in such subparagraph only so long as the member continues to undergo medical treatment for the disability, but in no event for longer than 5 years from the start of such treatment.

* (C) For purposes of this paragraph—

  * (i) the term "combat-related disability" has the meaning given such term by section 1413a(e) of title 10; and

  * (1) may accumulate without regard to any limitation under section 6304; and

### §6334. Donations of leave
* (a) An employee may, by written application to the employing agency of such employee, request that a specified number of hours be transferred from the annual leave account of such employee to the annual leave account of a leave recipient in accordance with section 6332.

* (b)(1) In any one leave year, a leave donor may donate no more than a total of one-half of the amount of annual leave such donor would be entitled to accrue during the leave year in which the donation is made.

* (2) A leave donor who is projected to have annual leave that otherwise would be subject to forfeiture at the end of the leave year under section 6304(a) may donate no more than the number of hours remaining in the leave year (as of the date of the transfer) for which the leave donor is scheduled to work and receive pay.

* (3) The employing agency of a leave donor may waive the limitation under paragraphs (1) and (2). Any such waiver shall be made in writing.

* (c) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations to include procedures to carry out this subchapter when the leave donor and the leave recipient are employed by different agencies.

### §6335. Termination of medical emergency
* (a) The medical emergency affecting a leave recipient shall, for purposes of this subchapter, be considered to have terminated on the date as of which—

  * (1) the leave recipient notifies the employing agency of such leave recipient, in writing, that the medical emergency no longer exists;

  * (2) the employing agency of such leave recipient determines, after written notice and opportunity for the leave recipient (or, if appropriate, another person acting on behalf of the leave recipient) to answer orally or in writing, that the medical emergency no longer exists; or

  * (3) the leave recipient is separated from service.

### §6336. Restoration of transferred leave
* (a)(1) The Office of Personnel Management shall establish procedures under which, except as provided in paragraph (2), any transferred leave remaining to the credit of a leave recipient when the medical emergency affecting the leave recipient terminates shall be restored on a prorated basis by transfer to the appropriate accounts of the respective leave donors.

* (2) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall require the restoration of leave to a leave donor—

  * (A) if the amount of leave which would be restored to such donor would be less than 1 hour or any other shorter period of time which the Office may by regulation prescribe;

  * (B) if such donor retires, dies, or is otherwise separated from service, before the date on which such restoration would otherwise be made; or

  * (C) if such restoration is not administratively feasible, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Office.


* (b) At the election of the leave donor, transferred annual leave restored to such leave donor under subsection (a) may be restored by—

  * (1) crediting such leave to the leave donor's annual leave account in the then current leave year;

  * (2) crediting such leave to the leave donor's annual leave account, effective as of the first day of the first leave year beginning after the date of the election; or

* (c) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which this section shall be applied in the case of an employee who is paid other than on the basis of biweekly pay periods.
