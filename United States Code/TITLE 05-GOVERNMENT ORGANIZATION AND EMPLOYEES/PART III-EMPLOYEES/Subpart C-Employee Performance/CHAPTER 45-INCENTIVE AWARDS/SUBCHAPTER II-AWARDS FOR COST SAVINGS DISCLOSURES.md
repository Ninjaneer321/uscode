### SUBCHAPTER II—AWARDS FOR COST SAVINGS DISCLOSURES

### §4511. Definition and general provisions
* (a) For purposes of this subchapter, the term "agency" means any Executive agency.

* (b) A cash award under this subchapter is in addition to the regular pay of the recipient. Acceptance of a cash award under this subchapter constitutes an agreement that the use by the Government of an idea, method, or device for which the award is made does not form the basis of a further claim of any nature against the Government by the employee, his heirs, or assigns.

### §4512. Agency awards for cost savings disclosures
* (a) The Inspector General of an agency, or any other agency employee designated under subsection (b), may pay a cash award to any employee of such agency whose disclosure of fraud, waste, or mismanagement to the Inspector General of the agency, or to such other designated agency employee, has resulted in cost savings for the agency. The amount of an award under this section may not exceed the lesser of—

  * (1) $10,000; or

  * (2) an amount equal to 1 percent of the agency's cost savings which the Inspector General, or other employee designated under subsection (b), determines to be the total savings attributable to the employee's disclosure.


* For purposes of paragraph (2), the Inspector General or other designated employee may take into account agency cost savings projected for subsequent fiscal years which will be attributable to such disclosure.

* (b) In the case of an agency for which there is no Inspector General, the head of the agency shall designate an agency employee who shall have the authority to make the determinations and grant the awards permitted under this section.

### §4513. Presidential awards for cost savings disclosures
* The President may pay a cash award in the amount of $20,000 to any employee whose disclosure of fraud, waste, or mismanagement has resulted in substantial cost savings for the Government. In evaluating the significance of a cost savings disclosure made by an employee for purposes of determining whether to make an award to such employee under this section, the President may take into account cost savings projected for subsequent fiscal years which will be attributable to the disclosure. During any fiscal year, the President may not make more than 50 awards under this section.
