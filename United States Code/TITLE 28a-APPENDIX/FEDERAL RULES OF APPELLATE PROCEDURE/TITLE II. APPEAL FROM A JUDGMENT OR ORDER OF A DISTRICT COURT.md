### TITLE II. APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF A DISTRICT COURT

### Rule 3. Appeal as of Right—How Taken
* (a) FILING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL.

  * (1) An appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4. At the time of filing, the appellant must furnish the clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with Rule 3(d).

  * (2) An appellant's failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the court of appeals to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.

  * (3) An appeal from a judgment by a magistrate judge in a civil case is taken in the same way as an appeal from any other district court judgment.

  * (4) An appeal by permission under 28 U.S.C. §1292(b) or an appeal in a bankruptcy case may be taken only in the manner prescribed by Rules 5 and 6, respectively.


* (b) JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED APPEALS.

  * (1) When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a district-court judgment or order, and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal. They may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.

  * (2) When the parties have filed separate timely notices of appeal, the appeals may be joined or consolidated by the court of appeals.


* (c) CONTENTS OF THE NOTICE OF APPEAL.

  * (1) The notice of appeal must:

    * (A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice, but an attorney representing more than one party may describe those parties with such terms as "all plaintiffs," "the defendants," "the plaintiffs A, B, et al.," or "all defendants except X";

    * (B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; and

    * (C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.


  * (2) A pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer's spouse and minor children (if they are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise.

  * (3) In a class action, whether or not the class has been certified, the notice of appeal is sufficient if it names one person qualified to bring the appeal as representative of the class.

  * (4) An appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.

  * (5) Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a notice of appeal.


* (d) SERVING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL.

  * (1) The district clerk must serve notice of the filing of a notice of appeal by sending a copy to each party's counsel of record—excluding the appellant's—or, if a party is proceeding pro se, to the party's last known address. When a defendant in a criminal case appeals, the clerk must also serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the defendant. The clerk must promptly send a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries—and any later docket entries—to the clerk of the court of appeals named in the notice. The district clerk must note, on each copy, the date when the notice of appeal was filed.

  * (2) If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in the manner provided by Rule 4(c), the district clerk must also note the date when the clerk docketed the notice.

  * (3) The district clerk's failure to serve notice does not affect the validity of the appeal. The clerk must note on the docket the names of the parties to whom the clerk sends copies, with the date of sending. Service is sufficient despite the death of a party or the party's counsel.


* (e) PAYMENT OF FEES. Upon filing a notice of appeal, the appellant must pay the district clerk all required fees. The district clerk receives the appellate docket fee on behalf of the court of appeals.

### Rule 4. Appeal as of Right—When Taken
* (a) APPEAL IN A CIVIL CASE.

  * (1) _Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal._

    * (A) In a civil case, except as provided in Rules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.

    * (B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from if one of the parties is:

      * (i) the United States;

      * (ii) a United States agency;

      * (iii) a United States officer or employee sued in an official capacity; or

      * (iv) a current or former United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States' behalf—including all instances in which the United States represents that person when the judgment or order is entered or files the appeal for that person.


    * (C) An appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error _coram nobis_ is an appeal in a civil case for purposes of Rule 4(a).


  * (2) _Filing Before Entry of Judgment._ A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision or order—but before the entry of the judgment or order—is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.

  * (3) _Multiple Appeals._ If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period ends later.

  * (4) _Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal._

    * (A) If a party files in the district court any of the following motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure—and does so within the time allowed by those rules—the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion:

      * (i) for judgment under Rule 50(b);

      * (ii) to amend or make additional factual findings under Rule 52(b), whether or not granting the motion would alter the judgment;

      * (iii) for attorney's fees under Rule 54 if the district court extends the time to appeal under Rule 58;

      * (iv) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59;

      * (v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or

      * (vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is filed no later than 28 days after the judgment is entered.


    * (B)(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment—but before it disposes of any motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)—the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order, in whole or in part, when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.

    * (ii) A party intending to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment's alteration or amendment upon such a motion, must file a notice of appeal, or an amended notice of appeal—in compliance with Rule 3(c)—within the time prescribed by this Rule measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.

    * (iii) No additional fee is required to file an amended notice.


  * (5) _Motion for Extension of Time._

    * (A) The district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if:

      * (i) a party so moves no later than 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires; and

      * (ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed before or during the 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that party shows excusable neglect or good cause.


    * (B) A motion filed before the expiration of the time prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be ex parte unless the court requires otherwise. If the motion is filed after the expiration of the prescribed time, notice must be given to the other parties in accordance with local rules.

    * (C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.


  * (6) _Reopening the Time to File an Appeal._ The district court may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but only if all the following conditions are satisfied:

    * (A) the court finds that the moving party did not receive notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed within 21 days after entry;

    * (B) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 14 days after the moving party receives notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is earlier; and

    * (C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.


  * (7) _Entry Defined._

    * (A) A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(a):

      * (i) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a) does not require a separate document, when the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a); or

      * (ii) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a) requires a separate document, when the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a) and when the earlier of these events occurs:

        * • the judgment or order is set forth on a separate document, or

        * • 150 days have run from entry of the judgment or order in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a).


    * (B) A failure to set forth a judgment or order on a separate document when required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a) does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment or order.


* (b) APPEAL IN A CRIMINAL CASE.

  * (1) _Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal._

    * (A) In a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days after the later of:

      * (i) the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed; or

      * (ii) the filing of the government's notice of appeal.


    * (B) When the government is entitled to appeal, its notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 30 days after the later of:

      * (i) the entry of the judgment or order being appealed; or

      * (ii) the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.


  * (2) _Filing Before Entry of Judgment._ A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order—but before the entry of the judgment or order—is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.

  * (3) _Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal._

    * (A) If a defendant timely makes any of the following motions under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the notice of appeal from a judgment of conviction must be filed within 14 days after the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion, or within 14 days after the entry of the judgment of conviction, whichever period ends later. This provision applies to a timely motion:

      * (i) for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29;

      * (ii) for a new trial under Rule 33, but if based on newly discovered evidence, only if the motion is made no later than 14 days after the entry of the judgment; or

      * (iii) for arrest of judgment under Rule 34.


    * (B) A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order—but before it disposes of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A)—becomes effective upon the later of the following:

      * (i) the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion; or

      * (ii) the entry of the judgment of conviction.


    * (C) A valid notice of appeal is effective—without amendment—to appeal from an order disposing of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A).


  * (4) _Motion for Extension of Time._ Upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may—before or after the time has expired, with or without motion and notice—extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).

  * (5) _Jurisdiction._ The filing of a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(b) does not divest a district court of jurisdiction to correct a sentence under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), nor does the filing of a motion under 35(a) affect the validity of a notice of appeal filed before entry of the order disposing of the motion. The filing of a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) does not suspend the time for filing a notice of appeal from a judgment of conviction.

  * (6) _Entry Defined._ A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is entered on the criminal docket.


* (c) APPEAL BY AN INMATE CONFINED IN AN INSTITUTION.

  * (1) If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate confined there must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 4(c)(1). If an inmate files a notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing and:

    * (A) it is accompanied by:

      * (i) a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746—or a notarized statement—setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being prepaid; or

      * (ii) evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the notice was so deposited and that postage was prepaid; or


    * (B) the court of appeals exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or notarized statement that satisfies Rule 4(c)(1)(A)(i).


  * (2) If an inmate files the first notice of appeal in a civil case under this Rule 4(c), the 14-day period provided in Rule 4(a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from the date when the district court dockets the first notice.

  * (3) When a defendant in a criminal case files a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(c), the 30-day period for the government to file its notice of appeal runs from the entry of the judgment or order appealed from or from the district court's docketing of the defendant's notice of appeal, whichever is later.


* (d) MISTAKEN FILING IN THE COURT OF APPEALS. If a notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case is mistakenly filed in the court of appeals, the clerk of that court must note on the notice the date when it was received and send it to the district clerk. The notice is then considered filed in the district court on the date so noted.

### Rule 5. Appeal by Permission
* (a) PETITION FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL.

  * (1) To request permission to appeal when an appeal is within the court of appeals' discretion, a party must file a petition with the circuit clerk and serve it on all other parties to the district-court action.

  * (2) The petition must be filed within the time specified by the statute or rule authorizing the appeal or, if no such time is specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a notice of appeal.

  * (3) If a party cannot petition for appeal unless the district court first enters an order granting permission to do so or stating that the necessary conditions are met, the district court may amend its order, either on its own or in response to a party's motion, to include the required permission or statement. In that event, the time to petition runs from entry of the amended order.


* (b) CONTENTS OF THE PETITION; ANSWER OR CROSS-PETITION; ORAL ARGUMENT.

  * (1) The petition must include the following:

    * (A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;

    * (B) the question itself;

    * (C) the relief sought;

    * (D) the reasons why the appeal should be allowed and is authorized by a statute or rule; and

    * (E) an attached copy of:

      * (i) the order, decree, or judgment complained of and any related opinion or memorandum, and

      * (ii) any order stating the district court's permission to appeal or finding that the necessary conditions are met.


  * (2) A party may file an answer in opposition or a cross-petition within 10 days after the petition is served.

  * (3) The petition and answer will be submitted without oral argument unless the court of appeals orders otherwise.


* (c) FORM OF PAPERS; NUMBER OF COPIES; LENGTH LIMITS. All papers must conform to Rule 32(c)(2). An original and 3 copies must be filed unless the court requires a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case. Except by the court's permission, and excluding the accompanying documents required by Rule 5(b)(1)(E):

  * (1) a paper produced using a computer must not exceed 5,200 words; and

  * (2) a handwritten or typewritten paper must not exceed 20 pages.


* (d) GRANT OF PERMISSION; FEES; COST BOND; FILING THE RECORD.

  * (1) Within 14 days after the entry of the order granting permission to appeal, the appellant must:

    * (A) pay the district clerk all required fees; and

    * (B) file a cost bond if required under Rule 7.


  * (2) A notice of appeal need not be filed. The date when the order granting permission to appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal for calculating time under these rules.

  * (3) The district clerk must notify the circuit clerk once the petitioner has paid the fees. Upon receiving this notice, the circuit clerk must enter the appeal on the docket. The record must be forwarded and filed in accordance with Rules 11 and 12(c).

### Rule 6. Appeal in a Bankruptcy Case
* (a) APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT, ORDER, OR DECREE OF A DISTRICT COURT EXERCISING ORIGINAL JURISDICTION IN A BANKRUPTCY CASE. An appeal to a court of appeals from a final judgment, order, or decree of a district court exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1334 is taken as any other civil appeal under these rules.

* (b) APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT, ORDER, OR DECREE OF A DISTRICT COURT OR BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL EXERCISING APPELLATE JURISDICTION IN A BANKRUPTCY CASE.

  * (1) _Applicability of Other Rules._ These rules apply to an appeal to a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(1) from a final judgment, order, or decree of a district court or bankruptcy appellate panel exercising appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §158(a) or (b), but with these qualifications:

    * (A) Rules 4(a)(4), 4(b), 9, 10, 11, 12(c), 13–20, 22–23, and 24(b) do not apply;

    * (B) the reference in Rule 3(c) to "Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms" must be read as a reference to Form 5;

    * (C) when the appeal is from a bankruptcy appellate panel, "district court," as used in any applicable rule, means "appellate panel"; and

    * (D) in Rule 12.1, "district court" includes a bankruptcy court or bankruptcy appellate panel.


  * (2) _Additional Rules._ In addition to the rules made applicable by Rule 6(b)(1), the following rules apply:

    * (A) _Motion for Rehearing._

      * (i) If a timely motion for rehearing under Bankruptcy Rule 8022 is filed, the time to appeal for all parties runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion. A notice of appeal filed after the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel announces or enters a judgment, order, or decree—but before disposition of the motion for rehearing—becomes effective when the order disposing of the motion for rehearing is entered.

      * (ii) If a party intends to challenge the order disposing of the motion—or the alteration or amendment of a judgment, order, or decree upon the motion—then the party, in compliance with Rules 3(c) and 6(b)(1)(B), must file a notice of appeal or amended notice of appeal. The notice or amended notice must be filed within the time prescribed by Rule 4—excluding Rules 4(a)(4) and 4(b)—measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion.

      * (iii) No additional fee is required to file an amended notice.


    * (B) _The Record on Appeal._

      * (i) Within 14 days after filing the notice of appeal, the appellant must file with the clerk possessing the record assembled in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 8009—and serve on the appellee—a statement of the issues to be presented on appeal and a designation of the record to be certified and made available to the circuit clerk.

      * (ii) An appellee who believes that other parts of the record are necessary must, within 14 days after being served with the appellant's designation, file with the clerk and serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to be included.

      * (iii) The record on appeal consists of:

        * • the redesignated record as provided above;

        * • the proceedings in the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel; and

        * • a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the clerk under Rule 3(d).


    * (C) _Making the Record Available._

      * (i) When the record is complete, the district clerk or bankruptcy-appellate-panel clerk must number the documents constituting the record and promptly make it available to the circuit clerk. If the clerk makes the record available in paper form, the clerk will not send documents of unusual bulk or weight, physical exhibits other than documents, or other parts of the record designated for omission by local rule of the court of appeals, unless directed to do so by a party or the circuit clerk. If unusually bulky or heavy exhibits are to be made available in paper form, a party must arrange with the clerks in advance for their transportation and receipt.

      * (ii) All parties must do whatever else is necessary to enable the clerk to assemble the record and make it available. When the record is made available in paper form, the court of appeals may provide by rule or order that a certified copy of the docket entries be made available in place of the redesignated record. But any party may request at any time during the pendency of the appeal that the redesignated record be made available.


    * (D) _Filing the Record._ When the district clerk or bankruptcy-appellate-panel clerk has made the record available, the circuit clerk must note that fact on the docket. The date noted on the docket serves as the filing date of the record. The circuit clerk must immediately notify all parties of the filing date.


* (c) DIRECT REVIEW BY PERMISSION UNDER 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2).

  * (1) _Applicability of Other Rules._ These rules apply to a direct appeal by permission under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2), but with these qualifications:

    * (A) Rules 3–4, 5(a)(3), 6(a), 6(b), 8(a), 8(c), 9–12, 13–20, 22–23, and 24(b) do not apply;

    * (B) as used in any applicable rule, "district court" or "district clerk" includes—to the extent appropriate—a bankruptcy court or bankruptcy appellate panel or its clerk; and

    * (C) the reference to "Rules 11 and 12(c)" in Rule 5(d)(3) must be read as a reference to Rules 6(c)(2)(B) and (C).


  * (2) _Additional Rules._ In addition, the following rules apply:

    * (A) _The Record on Appeal._ Bankruptcy Rule 8009 governs the record on appeal.

    * (B) _Making the Record Available._ Bankruptcy Rule 8010 governs completing the record and making it available.

    * (C) _Stays Pending Appeal._ Bankruptcy Rule 8007 applies to stays pending appeal.

    * (D) _Duties of the Circuit Clerk._ When the bankruptcy clerk has made the record available, the circuit clerk must note that fact on the docket. The date noted on the docket serves as the filing date of the record. The circuit clerk must immediately notify all parties of the filing date.

    * (E) _Filing a Representation Statement._ Unless the court of appeals designates another time, within 14 days after entry of the order granting permission to appeal, the attorney who sought permission must file a statement with the circuit clerk naming the parties that the attorney represents on appeal.

### Rule 7. Bond for Costs on Appeal in a Civil Case
* In a civil case, the district court may require an appellant to file a bond or provide other security in any form and amount necessary to ensure payment of costs on appeal. Rule 8(b) applies to a surety on a bond given under this rule.

### Rule 8. Stay or Injunction Pending Appeal
* (a) MOTION FOR STAY.

  * (1) _Initial Motion in the District Court._ A party must ordinarily move first in the district court for the following relief:

    * (A) a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal;

    * (B) approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment; or

    * (C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending.


  * (2) _Motion in the Court of Appeals; Conditions on Relief._ A motion for the relief mentioned in Rule 8(a)(1) may be made to the court of appeals or to one of its judges.

    * (A) The motion must:

      * (i) show that moving first in the district court would be impracticable; or

      * (ii) state that, a motion having been made, the district court denied the motion or failed to afford the relief requested and state any reasons given by the district court for its action.


    * (B) The motion must also include:

      * (i) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on;

      * (ii) originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and

      * (iii) relevant parts of the record.


    * (C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.

    * (D) A motion under this Rule 8(a)(2) must be filed with the circuit clerk and normally will be considered by a panel of the court. But in an exceptional case in which time requirements make that procedure impracticable, the motion may be made to and considered by a single judge.

    * (E) The court may condition relief on a party's filing a bond or other security in the district court.


* (b) PROCEEDING AGAINST A SECURITY PROVIDER. If a party gives security with one or more security providers, each provider submits to the jurisdiction of the district court and irrevocably appoints the district clerk as its agent on whom any papers affecting its liability on the security may be served. On motion, a security provider's liability may be enforced in the district court without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and any notice that the district court prescribes may be served on the district clerk, who must promptly send a copy to each security provider whose address is known.

* (c) STAY IN A CRIMINAL CASE. Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs a stay in a criminal case.

### Rule 9. Release in a Criminal Case
* (a) RELEASE BEFORE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION.

  * (1) The district court must state in writing, or orally on the record, the reasons for an order regarding the release or detention of a defendant in a criminal case. A party appealing from the order must file with the court of appeals a copy of the district court's order and the court's statement of reasons as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal. An appellant who questions the factual basis for the district court's order must file a transcript of the release proceedings or an explanation of why a transcript was not obtained.

  * (2) After reasonable notice to the appellee, the court of appeals must promptly determine the appeal on the basis of the papers, affidavits, and parts of the record that the parties present or the court requires. Unless the court so orders, briefs need not be filed.

  * (3) The court of appeals or one of its judges may order the defendant's release pending the disposition of the appeal.


* (b) RELEASE AFTER JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION. A party entitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of conviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in the court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. Both the order and the review are subject to Rule 9(a). The papers filed by the party seeking review must include a copy of the judgment of conviction.

* (c) CRITERIA FOR RELEASE. The court must make its decision regarding release in accordance with the applicable provisions of 18 U.S.C. §§3142, 3143, and 3145(c).

### Rule 10. The Record on Appeal
* (a) COMPOSITION OF THE RECORD ON APPEAL. The following items constitute the record on appeal:

  * (1) the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court;

  * (2) the transcript of proceedings, if any; and

  * (3) a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the district clerk.


* (b) THE TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS.

  * (1) _Appellant's Duty to Order._ Within 14 days after filing the notice of appeal or entry of an order disposing of the last timely remaining motion of a type specified in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), whichever is later, the appellant must do either of the following:

    * (A) order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant considers necessary, subject to a local rule of the court of appeals and with the following qualifications:

      * (i) the order must be in writing;

      * (ii) if the cost of the transcript is to be paid by the United States under the Criminal Justice Act, the order must so state; and

      * (iii) the appellant must, within the same period, file a copy of the order with the district clerk; or


    * (B) file a certificate stating that no transcript will be ordered.


  * (2) _Unsupported Finding or Conclusion._ If the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.

  * (3) _Partial Transcript._ Unless the entire transcript is ordered:

    * (A) the appellant must—within the 14 days provided in Rule 10(b)(1)—file a statement of the issues that the appellant intends to present on the appeal and must serve on the appellee a copy of both the order or certificate and the statement;

    * (B) if the appellee considers it necessary to have a transcript of other parts of the proceedings, the appellee must, within 14 days after the service of the order or certificate and the statement of the issues, file and serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to be ordered; and

    * (C) unless within 14 days after service of that designation the appellant has ordered all such parts, and has so notified the appellee, the appellee may within the following 14 days either order the parts or move in the district court for an order requiring the appellant to do so.


  * (4) _Payment._ At the time of ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the reporter for paying the cost of the transcript.


* (c) STATEMENT OF THE EVIDENCE WHEN THE PROCEEDINGS WERE NOT RECORDED OR WHEN A TRANSCRIPT IS UNAVAILABLE. If the transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection. The statement must be served on the appellee, who may serve objections or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the district court for settlement and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the district clerk in the record on appeal.

* (d) AGREED STATEMENT AS THE RECORD ON APPEAL. In place of the record on appeal as defined in Rule 10(a), the parties may prepare, sign, and submit to the district court a statement of the case showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the district court. The statement must set forth only those facts averred and proved or sought to be proved that are essential to the court's resolution of the issues. If the statement is truthful, it—together with any additions that the district court may consider necessary to a full presentation of the issues on appeal—must be approved by the district court and must then be certified to the court of appeals as the record on appeal. The district clerk must then send it to the circuit clerk within the time provided by Rule 11. A copy of the agreed statement may be filed in place of the appendix required by Rule 30.

* (e) CORRECTION OR MODIFICATION OF THE RECORD.

  * (1) If any difference arises about whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the district court, the difference must be submitted to and settled by that court and the record conformed accordingly.

  * (2) If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be certified and forwarded:

    * (A) on stipulation of the parties;

    * (B) by the district court before or after the record has been forwarded; or

    * (C) by the court of appeals.


  * (3) All other questions as to the form and content of the record must be presented to the court of appeals.

### Rule 11. Forwarding the Record
* (a) APPELLANT'S DUTY. An appellant filing a notice of appeal must comply with Rule 10(b) and must do whatever else is necessary to enable the clerk to assemble and forward the record. If there are multiple appeals from a judgment or order, the clerk must forward a single record.

* (b) DUTIES OF REPORTER AND DISTRICT CLERK.

  * (1) _Reporter's Duty to Prepare and File a Transcript._ The reporter must prepare and file a transcript as follows:

    * (A) Upon receiving an order for a transcript, the reporter must enter at the foot of the order the date of its receipt and the expected completion date and send a copy, so endorsed, to the circuit clerk.

    * (B) If the transcript cannot be completed within 30 days of the reporter's receipt of the order, the reporter may request the circuit clerk to grant additional time to complete it. The clerk must note on the docket the action taken and notify the parties.

    * (C) When a transcript is complete, the reporter must file it with the district clerk and notify the circuit clerk of the filing.

    * (D) If the reporter fails to file the transcript on time, the circuit clerk must notify the district judge and do whatever else the court of appeals directs.


  * (2) _District Clerk's Duty to Forward._ When the record is complete, the district clerk must number the documents constituting the record and send them promptly to the circuit clerk together with a list of the documents correspondingly numbered and reasonably identified. Unless directed to do so by a party or the circuit clerk, the district clerk will not send to the court of appeals documents of unusual bulk or weight, physical exhibits other than documents, or other parts of the record designated for omission by local rule of the court of appeals. If the exhibits are unusually bulky or heavy, a party must arrange with the clerks in advance for their transportation and receipt.


* (c) RETAINING THE RECORD TEMPORARILY IN THE DISTRICT COURT FOR USE IN PREPARING THE APPEAL. The parties may stipulate, or the district court on motion may order, that the district clerk retain the record temporarily for the parties to use in preparing the papers on appeal. In that event the district clerk must certify to the circuit clerk that the record on appeal is complete. Upon receipt of the appellee's brief, or earlier if the court orders or the parties agree, the appellant must request the district clerk to forward the record.

* (d) [ABROGATED.]

* (e) RETAINING THE RECORD BY COURT ORDER.

  * (1) The court of appeals may, by order or local rule, provide that a certified copy of the docket entries be forwarded instead of the entire record. But a party may at any time during the appeal request that designated parts of the record be forwarded.

  * (2) The district court may order the record or some part of it retained if the court needs it while the appeal is pending, subject, however, to call by the court of appeals.

  * (3) If part or all of the record is ordered retained, the district clerk must send to the court of appeals a copy of the order and the docket entries together with the parts of the original record allowed by the district court and copies of any parts of the record designated by the parties.


* (f) RETAINING PARTS OF THE RECORD IN THE DISTRICT COURT BY STIPULATION OF THE PARTIES. The parties may agree by written stipulation filed in the district court that designated parts of the record be retained in the district court subject to call by the court of appeals or request by a party. The parts of the record so designated remain a part of the record on appeal.

* (g) RECORD FOR A PRELIMINARY MOTION IN THE COURT OF APPEALS. If, before the record is forwarded, a party makes any of the following motions in the court of appeals:

  * • for dismissal;

  * • for release;

  * • for a stay pending appeal;

  * • for additional security on the bond on appeal or on a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment; or

  * • for any other intermediate order—


* the district clerk must send the court of appeals any parts of the record designated by any party.

### Rule 12. Docketing the Appeal; Filing a Representation Statement; Filing the Record
* (a) DOCKETING THE APPEAL. Upon receiving the copy of the notice of appeal and the docket entries from the district clerk under Rule 3(d), the circuit clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the district-court action and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant's name if necessary.

* (b) FILING A REPRESENTATION STATEMENT. Unless the court of appeals designates another time, the attorney who filed the notice of appeal must, within 14 days after filing the notice, file a statement with the circuit clerk naming the parties that the attorney represents on appeal.

* (c) FILING THE RECORD, PARTIAL RECORD, OR CERTIFICATE. Upon receiving the record, partial record, or district clerk's certificate as provided in Rule 11, the circuit clerk must file it and immediately notify all parties of the filing date.

### Rule 12.1. Remand After an Indicative Ruling by the District Court on a Motion for Relief That Is Barred by a Pending Appeal
* (a) NOTICE TO THE COURT OF APPEALS. If a timely motion is made in the district court for relief that it lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the movant must promptly notify the circuit clerk if the district court states either that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

* (b) REMAND AFTER AN INDICATIVE RULING. If the district court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue, the court of appeals may remand for further proceedings but retains jurisdiction unless it expressly dismisses the appeal. If the court of appeals remands but retains jurisdiction, the parties must promptly notify the circuit clerk when the district court has decided the motion on remand.
