### TITLE VI. HABEAS CORPUS; PROCEEDINGS IN FORMA PAUPERIS

### Rule 22. Habeas Corpus and Section 2255 Proceedings
* (a) APPLICATION FOR THE ORIGINAL WRIT. An application for a writ of habeas corpus must be made to the appropriate district court. If made to a circuit judge, the application must be transferred to the appropriate district court. If a district court denies an application made or transferred to it, renewal of the application before a circuit judge is not permitted. The applicant may, under 28 U.S.C. §2253, appeal to the court of appeals from the district court's order denying the application.

* (b) CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY.

  * (1) In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises from process issued by a state court, or in a 28 U.S.C. §2255 proceeding, the applicant cannot take an appeal unless a circuit justice or a circuit or district judge issues a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. §2253(c). If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the district clerk must send to the court of appeals the certificate (if any) and the statement described in Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Proceedings Under 28 U.S.C. §2254 or §2255 (if any), along with the notice of appeal and the file of the district-court proceedings. If the district judge has denied the certificate, the applicant may request a circuit judge to issue it.

  * (2) A request addressed to the court of appeals may be considered by a circuit judge or judges, as the court prescribes. If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal constitutes a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals.

  * (3) A certificate of appealability is not required when a state or its representative or the United States or its representative appeals.

### Rule 23. Custody or Release of a Prisoner in a Habeas Corpus Proceeding
* (a) TRANSFER OF CUSTODY PENDING REVIEW. Pending review of a decision in a habeas corpus proceeding commenced before a court, justice, or judge of the United States for the release of a prisoner, the person having custody of the prisoner must not transfer custody to another unless a transfer is directed in accordance with this rule. When, upon application, a custodian shows the need for a transfer, the court, justice, or judge rendering the decision under review may authorize the transfer and substitute the successor custodian as a party.

* (b) DETENTION OR RELEASE PENDING REVIEW OF DECISION NOT TO RELEASE. While a decision not to release a prisoner is under review, the court or judge rendering the decision, or the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, or a judge or justice of either court, may order that the prisoner be:

  * (1) detained in the custody from which release is sought;

  * (2) detained in other appropriate custody; or

  * (3) released on personal recognizance, with or without surety.


* (c) RELEASE PENDING REVIEW OF DECISION ORDERING RELEASE. While a decision ordering the release of a prisoner is under review, the prisoner must—unless the court or judge rendering the decision, or the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, or a judge or justice of either court orders otherwise—be released on personal recognizance, with or without surety.

* (d) MODIFICATION OF THE INITIAL ORDER ON CUSTODY. An initial order governing the prisoner's custody or release, including any recognizance or surety, continues in effect pending review unless for special reasons shown to the court of appeals or the Supreme Court, or to a judge or justice of either court, the order is modified or an independent order regarding custody, release, or surety is issued.

### Rule 24. Proceeding in Forma Pauperis
* (a) LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS.

  * (1) _Motion in the District Court._ Except as stated in Rule 24(a)(3), a party to a district-court action who desires to appeal in forma pauperis must file a motion in the district court. The party must attach an affidavit that:

    * (A) shows in the detail prescribed by Form 4 of the Appendix of Forms the party's inability to pay or to give security for fees and costs;

    * (B) claims an entitlement to redress; and

    * (C) states the issues that the party intends to present on appeal.


  * (2) _Action on the Motion._ If the district court grants the motion, the party may proceed on appeal without prepaying or giving security for fees and costs, unless a statute provides otherwise. If the district court denies the motion, it must state its reasons in writing.

  * (3) _Prior Approval._ A party who was permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in the district-court action, or who was determined to be financially unable to obtain an adequate defense in a criminal case, may proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without further authorization, unless:

    * (A) the district court—before or after the notice of appeal is filed—certifies that the appeal is not taken in good faith or finds that the party is not otherwise entitled to proceed in forma pauperis and states in writing its reasons for the certification or finding; or

    * (B) a statute provides otherwise.


  * (4) _Notice of District Court's Denial_. The district clerk must immediately notify the parties and the court of appeals when the district court does any of the following:

    * (A) denies a motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis;

    * (B) certifies that the appeal is not taken in good faith; or

    * (C) finds that the party is not otherwise entitled to proceed in forma pauperis.


  * (5) _Motion in the Court of Appeals._ A party may file a motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis in the court of appeals within 30 days after service of the notice prescribed in Rule 24(a)(4). The motion must include a copy of the affidavit filed in the district court and the district court's statement of reasons for its action. If no affidavit was filed in the district court, the party must include the affidavit prescribed by Rule 24(a)(1).


* (b) LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT OR ON APPEAL OR REVIEW OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE-AGENCY PROCEEDING. A party may file in the court of appeals a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis with an affidavit prescribed by Rule 24(a)(1):

  * (1) in an appeal from the United States Tax Court; and

  * (2) when an appeal or review of a proceeding before an administrative agency, board, commission, or officer proceeds directly in the court of appeals.


* (c) LEAVE TO USE ORIGINAL RECORD. A party allowed to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis may request that the appeal be heard on the original record without reproducing any part.
