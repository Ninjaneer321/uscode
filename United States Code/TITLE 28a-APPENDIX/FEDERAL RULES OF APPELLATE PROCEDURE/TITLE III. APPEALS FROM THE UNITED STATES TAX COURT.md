### TITLE III. APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT

### Rule 13. Appeals from the Tax Court
* (a) APPEAL AS OF RIGHT.

  * (1) _How Obtained; Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal._

    * (A) An appeal as of right from the United States Tax Court is commenced by filing a notice of appeal with the Tax Court clerk within 90 days after the entry of the Tax Court's decision. At the time of filing, the appellant must furnish the clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with Rule 3(d). If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 120 days after the Tax Court's decision is entered.

    * (B) If, under Tax Court rules, a party makes a timely motion to vacate or revise the Tax Court's decision, the time to file a notice of appeal runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion or from the entry of a new decision, whichever is later.


  * (2) _Notice of Appeal; How Filed._ The notice of appeal may be filed either at the Tax Court clerk's office in the District of Columbia or by sending it to the clerk. If sent by mail the notice is considered filed on the postmark date, subject to §7502 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the applicable regulations.

  * (3) _Contents of the Notice of Appeal; Service; Effect of Filing and Service._ Rule 3 prescribes the contents of a notice of appeal, the manner of service, and the effect of its filing and service. Form 2 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a notice of appeal.

  * (4) _The Record on Appeal; Forwarding; Filing._

    * (A) Except as otherwise provided under Tax Court rules for the transcript of proceedings, the appeal is governed by the parts of Rules 10, 11, and 12 regarding the record on appeal from a district court, the time and manner of forwarding and filing, and the docketing in the court of appeals.

    * (B) If an appeal is taken to more than one court of appeals, the original record must be sent to the court named in the first notice of appeal filed. In an appeal to any other court of appeals, the appellant must apply to that other court to make provision for the record.


* (b) _Appeal by Permission._ An appeal by permission is governed by Rule 5.

### Rule 14. Applicability of Other Rules to Appeals from the Tax Court
