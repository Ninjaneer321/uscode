### ARTICLE II. JUDICIAL NOTICE

### Rule 201. Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts
* (a) SCOPE. This rule governs judicial notice of an adjudicative fact only, not a legislative fact.

* (b) KINDS OF FACTS THAT MAY BE JUDICIALLY NOTICED. The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it:

  * (1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or

  * (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.


* (c) TAKING NOTICE. The court:

  * (1) may take judicial notice on its own; or

  * (2) must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information.


* (d) TIMING. The court may take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.

* (e) OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. On timely request, a party is entitled to be heard on the propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed. If the court takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is still entitled to be heard.

* (f) INSTRUCTING THE JURY. In a civil case, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed fact as conclusive. In a criminal case, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.
