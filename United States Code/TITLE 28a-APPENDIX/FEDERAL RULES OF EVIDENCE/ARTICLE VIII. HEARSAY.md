  * (1) _A Declarant-Witness's Prior Statement._ The declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination about a prior statement, and the statement:

    * (A) is inconsistent with the declarant's testimony and was given under penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition;

    * (B) is consistent with the declarant's testimony and is offered:

      * (i) to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent improper influence or motive in so testifying; or

### Rule 804. Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay—When the Declarant Is Unavailable as a Witness
* (a) CRITERIA FOR BEING UNAVAILABLE. A declarant is considered to be unavailable as a witness if the declarant:

  * (1) is exempted from testifying about the subject matter of the declarant's statement because the court rules that a privilege applies;

  * (2) refuses to testify about the subject matter despite a court order to do so;

  * (3) testifies to not remembering the subject matter;

  * (4) cannot be present or testify at the trial or hearing because of death or a then-existing infirmity, physical illness, or mental illness; or

  * (5) is absent from the trial or hearing and the statement's proponent has not been able, by process or other reasonable means, to procure:

    * (A) the declarant's attendance, in the case of a hearsay exception under Rule 804(b)(1) or (6); or

    * (B) the declarant's attendance or testimony, in the case of a hearsay exception under Rule 804(b)(2), (3), or (4).


  * But this subdivision (a) does not apply if the statement's proponent procured or wrongfully caused the declarant's unavailability as a witness in order to prevent the declarant from attending or testifying.


* (b) THE EXCEPTIONS. The following are not excluded by the rule against hearsay if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:

  * (1) _Former Testimony._ Testimony that:

    * (A) was given as a witness at a trial, hearing, or lawful deposition, whether given during the current proceeding or a different one; and

    * (B) is now offered against a party who had—or, in a civil case, whose predecessor in interest had—an opportunity and similar motive to develop it by direct, cross-, or redirect examination.


  * (2) _Statement Under the Belief of Imminent Death._ In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil case, a statement that the declarant, while believing the declarant's death to be imminent, made about its cause or circumstances.

  * (3) _Statement Against Interest._ A statement that:

    * (A) a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it was so contrary to the declarant's proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarant's claim against someone else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability; and

    * (B) is supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness, if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability.


  * (4) _Statement of Personal or Family History._ A statement about:

    * (A) the declarant's own birth, adoption, legitimacy, ancestry, marriage, divorce, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, or similar facts of personal or family history, even though the declarant had no way of acquiring personal knowledge about that fact; or

    * (B) another person concerning any of these facts, as well as death, if the declarant was related to the person by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the person's family that the declarant's information is likely to be accurate.


  * (5) [_Other Exceptions._] [Transferred to Rule 807.]

  * (6) _Statement Offered Against a Party That Wrongfully Caused the Declarant's Unavailability._ A statement offered against a party that wrongfully caused—or acquiesced in wrongfully causing—the declarant's unavailability as a witness, and did so intending that result.

### Rule 805. Hearsay Within Hearsay
* Hearsay within hearsay is not excluded by the rule against hearsay if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the rule.

### Rule 806. Attacking and Supporting the Declarant's Credibility
* When a hearsay statement—or a statement described in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E)—has been admitted in evidence, the declarant's credibility may be attacked, and then supported, by any evidence that would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness. The court may admit evidence of the declarant's inconsistent statement or conduct, regardless of when it occurred or whether the declarant had an opportunity to explain or deny it. If the party against whom the statement was admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party may examine the declarant on the statement as if on cross-examination.

### Rule 807. Residual Exception
* (a) IN GENERAL. Under the following conditions, a hearsay statement is not excluded by the rule against hearsay even if the statement is not admissible under a hearsay exception in Rule 803 or 804:

  * (1) the statement is supported by sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness—after considering the totality of circumstances under which it was made and evidence, if any, corroborating the statement; and

  * (2) it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts.


* (b) NOTICE. The statement is admissible only if the proponent gives an adverse party reasonable notice of the intent to offer the statement—including its substance and the declarant's name—so that the party has a fair opportunity to meet it. The notice must be provided in writing before the trial or hearing—or in any form during the trial or hearing if the court, for good cause, excuses a lack of earlier notice.
