### ARTICLE V. PRIVILEGES

### Rule 501. Privilege in General
* The common law—as interpreted by United States courts in the light of reason and experience—governs a claim of privilege unless any of the following provides otherwise:

  * • the United States Constitution;

  * • a federal statute; or

  * • rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.


* But in a civil case, state law governs privilege regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.

### Rule 502. Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver
* The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.

* (a) DISCLOSURE MADE IN A FEDERAL PROCEEDING OR TO A FEDERAL OFFICE OR AGENCY; SCOPE OF A WAIVER. When the disclosure is made in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency and waives the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection, the waiver extends to an undisclosed communication or information in a federal or state proceeding only if:

  * (1) the waiver is intentional;

  * (2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information concern the same subject matter; and

  * (3) they ought in fairness to be considered together.


* (b) INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE. When made in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a federal or state proceeding if:

  * (1) the disclosure is inadvertent;

  * (2) the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure; and

  * (3) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error, including (if applicable) following Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(B).


* (c) DISCLOSURE MADE IN A STATE PROCEEDING. When the disclosure is made in a state proceeding and is not the subject of a state-court order concerning waiver, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a federal proceeding if the disclosure:

  * (1) would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been made in a federal proceeding; or

  * (2) is not a waiver under the law of the state where the disclosure occurred.


* (d) CONTROLLING EFFECT OF A COURT ORDER. A federal court may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the court—in which event the disclosure is also not a waiver in any other federal or state proceeding.

* (e) CONTROLLING EFFECT OF A PARTY AGREEMENT. An agreement on the effect of disclosure in a federal proceeding is binding only on the parties to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a court order.

* (f) CONTROLLING EFFECT OF THIS RULE. Notwithstanding Rules 101 and 1101, this rule applies to state proceedings and to federal court-annexed and federal court-mandated arbitration proceedings, in the circumstances set out in the rule. And notwithstanding Rule 501, this rule applies even if state law provides the rule of decision.

* (g) DEFINITIONS. In this rule:

  * (1) "attorney-client privilege" means the protection that applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client communications; and

  * (2) "work-product protection" means the protection that applicable law provides for tangible material (or its intangible equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.
