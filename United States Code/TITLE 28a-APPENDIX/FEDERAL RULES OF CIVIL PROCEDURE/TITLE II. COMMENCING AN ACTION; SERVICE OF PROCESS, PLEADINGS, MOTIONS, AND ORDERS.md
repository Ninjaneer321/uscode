### TITLE II. COMMENCING AN ACTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS, PLEADINGS, MOTIONS, AND ORDERS

### Rule 3. Commencing an Action
* A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.

### Rule 4. Summons
* (a) CONTENTS; AMENDMENTS.

  * (1) _Contents._ A summons must:

    * (A) name the court and the parties;

    * (B) be directed to the defendant;

    * (C) state the name and address of the plaintiff's attorney or—if unrepresented—of the plaintiff;

    * (D) state the time within which the defendant must appear and defend;

    * (E) notify the defendant that a failure to appear and defend will result in a default judgment against the defendant for the relief demanded in the complaint;

    * (F) be signed by the clerk; and

    * (G) bear the court's seal.


  * (2) _Amendments._ The court may permit a summons to be amended.


* (b) ISSUANCE. On or after filing the complaint, the plaintiff may present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal. If the summons is properly completed, the clerk must sign, seal, and issue it to the plaintiff for service on the defendant. A summons—or a copy of a summons that is addressed to multiple defendants—must be issued for each defendant to be served.

* (c) SERVICE.

  * (1) _In General._ A summons must be served with a copy of the complaint. The plaintiff is responsible for having the summons and complaint served within the time allowed by Rule 4(m) and must furnish the necessary copies to the person who makes service.

  * (2) _By Whom._ Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a summons and complaint.

  * (3) _By a Marshal or Someone Specially Appointed._ At the plaintiff's request, the court may order that service be made by a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed by the court. The court must so order if the plaintiff is authorized to proceed in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C. §1915 or as a seaman under 28 U.S.C. §1916.


* (d) WAIVING SERVICE.

  * (1) _Requesting a Waiver._ An individual, corporation, or association that is subject to service under Rule 4(e), (f), or (h) has a duty to avoid unnecessary expenses of serving the summons. The plaintiff may notify such a defendant that an action has been commenced and request that the defendant waive service of a summons. The notice and request must:

    * (A) be in writing and be addressed:

      * (i) to the individual defendant; or

      * (ii) for a defendant subject to service under Rule 4(h), to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process;


    * (B) name the court where the complaint was filed;

    * (C) be accompanied by a copy of the complaint, 2 copies of the waiver form appended to this Rule 4, and a prepaid means for returning the form;

    * (D) inform the defendant, using the form appended to this Rule 4, of the consequences of waiving and not waiving service;

    * (E) state the date when the request is sent;

    * (F) give the defendant a reasonable time of at least 30 days after the request was sent—or at least 60 days if sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States—to return the waiver; and

    * (G) be sent by first-class mail or other reliable means.


  * (2) _Failure to Waive._ If a defendant located within the United States fails, without good cause, to sign and return a waiver requested by a plaintiff located within the United States, the court must impose on the defendant:

    * (A) the expenses later incurred in making service; and

    * (B) the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, of any motion required to collect those service expenses.


  * (3) _Time to Answer After a Waiver._ A defendant who, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver need not serve an answer to the complaint until 60 days after the request was sent—or until 90 days after it was sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States.

  * (4) _Results of Filing a Waiver._ When the plaintiff files a waiver, proof of service is not required and these rules apply as if a summons and complaint had been served at the time of filing the waiver.

  * (5) _Jurisdiction and Venue Not Waived._ Waiving service of a summons does not waive any objection to personal jurisdiction or to venue.


* (e) SERVING AN INDIVIDUAL WITHIN A JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF THE UNITED STATES. Unless federal law provides otherwise, an individual—other than a minor, an incompetent person, or a person whose waiver has been filed—may be served in a judicial district of the United States by:

  * (1) following state law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located or where service is made; or

  * (2) doing any of the following:

    * (A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the individual personally;

    * (B) leaving a copy of each at the individual's dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there; or

    * (C) delivering a copy of each to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.


* (f) SERVING AN INDIVIDUAL IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. Unless federal law provides otherwise, an individual—other than a minor, an incompetent person, or a person whose waiver has been filed—may be served at a place not within any judicial district of the United States:

  * (1) by any internationally agreed means of service that is reasonably calculated to give notice, such as those authorized by the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents;

  * (2) if there is no internationally agreed means, or if an international agreement allows but does not specify other means, by a method that is reasonably calculated to give notice:

    * (A) as prescribed by the foreign country's law for service in that country in an action in its courts of general jurisdiction;

    * (B) as the foreign authority directs in response to a letter rogatory or letter of request; or

    * (C) unless prohibited by the foreign country's law, by:

      * (i) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the individual personally; or

      * (ii) using any form of mail that the clerk addresses and sends to the individual and that requires a signed receipt; or


  * (3) by other means not prohibited by international agreement, as the court orders.


* (g) SERVING A MINOR OR AN INCOMPETENT PERSON. A minor or an incompetent person in a judicial district of the United States must be served by following state law for serving a summons or like process on such a defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of the state where service is made. A minor or an incompetent person who is not within any judicial district of the United States must be served in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(f)(2)(A), (f)(2)(B), or (f)(3).

* (h) SERVING A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP, OR ASSOCIATION. Unless federal law provides otherwise or the defendant's waiver has been filed, a domestic or foreign corporation, or a partnership or other unincorporated association that is subject to suit under a common name, must be served:

  * (1) in a judicial district of the United States:

    * (A) in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(e)(1) for serving an individual; or

    * (B) by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and—if the agent is one authorized by statute and the statute so requires—by also mailing a copy of each to the defendant; or


  * (2) at a place not within any judicial district of the United States, in any manner prescribed by Rule 4(f) for serving an individual, except personal delivery under (f)(2)(C)(i).


* (i) SERVING THE UNITED STATES AND ITS AGENCIES, CORPORATIONS, OFFICERS, OR EMPLOYEES.

  * (1) _United States._ To serve the United States, a party must:

    * (A)(i) deliver a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the United States attorney for the district where the action is brought—or to an assistant United States attorney or clerical employee whom the United States attorney designates in a writing filed with the court clerk—or

    * (ii) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the civil-process clerk at the United States attorney's office;

    * (B) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, D.C.; and

    * (C) if the action challenges an order of a nonparty agency or officer of the United States, send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the agency or officer.


  * (2) _Agency; Corporation; Officer or Employee Sued in an Official Capacity._ To serve a United States agency or corporation, or a United States officer or employee sued only in an official capacity, a party must serve the United States and also send a copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail to the agency, corporation, officer, or employee.

  * (3) _Officer or Employee Sued Individually._ To serve a United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States' behalf (whether or not the officer or employee is also sued in an official capacity), a party must serve the United States and also serve the officer or employee under Rule 4(e), (f), or (g).

  * (4) _Extending Time._ The court must allow a party a reasonable time to cure its failure to:

    * (A) serve a person required to be served under Rule 4(i)(2), if the party has served either the United States attorney or the Attorney General of the United States; or

    * (B) serve the United States under Rule 4(i)(3), if the party has served the United States officer or employee.


* (j) SERVING A FOREIGN, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

  * (1) _Foreign State._ A foreign state or its political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality must be served in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §1608.

  * (2) _State or Local Government._ A state, a municipal corporation, or any other state-created governmental organization that is subject to suit must be served by:

    * (A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to its chief executive officer; or

    * (B) serving a copy of each in the manner prescribed by that state's law for serving a summons or like process on such a defendant.


* (k) TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE.

  * (1) _In General._ Serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant:

    * (A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located;

    * (B) who is a party joined under Rule 14 or 19 and is served within a judicial district of the United States and not more than 100 miles from where the summons was issued; or

    * (C) when authorized by a federal statute.


  * (2) _Federal Claim Outside State-Court Jurisdiction._ For a claim that arises under federal law, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant if:

    * (A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state's courts of general jurisdiction; and

    * (B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United States Constitution and laws.


* (l) PROVING SERVICE.

  * (1) _Affidavit Required._ Unless service is waived, proof of service must be made to the court. Except for service by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, proof must be by the server's affidavit.

  * (2) _Service Outside the United States._ Service not within any judicial district of the United States must be proved as follows:

    * (A) if made under Rule 4(f)(1), as provided in the applicable treaty or convention; or

    * (B) if made under Rule 4(f)(2) or (f)(3), by a receipt signed by the addressee, or by other evidence satisfying the court that the summons and complaint were delivered to the addressee.


  * (3) _Validity of Service; Amending Proof._ Failure to prove service does not affect the validity of service. The court may permit proof of service to be amended.


* (m) TIME LIMIT FOR SERVICE. If a defendant is not served within 90 days after the complaint is filed, the court—on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff—must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision (m) does not apply to service in a foreign country under Rule 4(f), 4(h)(2), or 4(j)(1), or to service of a notice under Rule 71.1(d)(3)(A).

* (n) ASSERTING JURISDICTION OVER PROPERTY OR ASSETS.

  * (1) _Federal Law._ The court may assert jurisdiction over property if authorized by a federal statute. Notice to claimants of the property must be given as provided in the statute or by serving a summons under this rule.

  * (2) _State Law._ On a showing that personal jurisdiction over a defendant cannot be obtained in the district where the action is brought by reasonable efforts to serve a summons under this rule, the court may assert jurisdiction over the defendant's assets found in the district. Jurisdiction is acquired by seizing the assets under the circumstances and in the manner provided by state law in that district.

### Rule 4.1. Serving Other Process
* (a) IN GENERAL. Process—other than a summons under Rule 4 or a subpoena under Rule 45—must be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed for that purpose. It may be served anywhere within the territorial limits of the state where the district court is located and, if authorized by a federal statute, beyond those limits. Proof of service must be made under Rule 4(l).

* (b) ENFORCING ORDERS: COMMITTING FOR CIVIL CONTEMPT. An order committing a person for civil contempt of a decree or injunction issued to enforce federal law may be served and enforced in any district. Any other order in a civil-contempt proceeding may be served only in the state where the issuing court is located or elsewhere in the United States within 100 miles from where the order was issued.

### Rule 5. Serving and Filing Pleadings and Other Papers
* (a) SERVICE: WHEN REQUIRED.

  * (1) _In General._ Unless these rules provide otherwise, each of the following papers must be served on every party:

    * (A) an order stating that service is required;

    * (B) a pleading filed after the original complaint, unless the court orders otherwise under Rule 5(c) because there are numerous defendants;

    * (C) a discovery paper required to be served on a party, unless the court orders otherwise;

    * (D) a written motion, except one that may be heard ex parte; and

    * (E) a written notice, appearance, demand, or offer of judgment, or any similar paper.


  * (2) _If a Party Fails to Appear._ No service is required on a party who is in default for failing to appear. But a pleading that asserts a new claim for relief against such a party must be served on that party under Rule 4.

  * (3) _Seizing Property._ If an action is begun by seizing property and no person is or need be named as a defendant, any service required before the filing of an appearance, answer, or claim must be made on the person who had custody or possession of the property when it was seized.


* (b) SERVICE: HOW MADE.

  * (1) _Serving an Attorney._ If a party is represented by an attorney, service under this rule must be made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.

  * (2) _Service in General._ A paper is served under this rule by:

    * (A) handing it to the person;

    * (B) leaving it:

      * (i) at the person's office with a clerk or other person in charge or, if no one is in charge, in a conspicuous place in the office; or

      * (ii) if the person has no office or the office is closed, at the person's dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there;


    * (C) mailing it to the person's last known address—in which event service is complete upon mailing;

    * (D) leaving it with the court clerk if the person has no known address;

    * (E) sending it to a registered user by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system or sending it by other electronic means that the person consented to in writing—in either of which events service is complete upon filing or sending, but is not effective if the filer or sender learns that it did not reach the person to be served; or

    * (F) delivering it by any other means that the person consented to in writing—in which event service is complete when the person making service delivers it to the agency designated to make delivery.


  * (3) _Using Court Facilities._ [Abrogated (Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)]


* (c) SERVING NUMEROUS DEFENDANTS.

  * (1) _In General._ If an action involves an unusually large number of defendants, the court may, on motion or on its own, order that:

    * (A) defendants' pleadings and replies to them need not be served on other defendants;

    * (B) any crossclaim, counterclaim, avoidance, or affirmative defense in those pleadings and replies to them will be treated as denied or avoided by all other parties; and

    * (C) filing any such pleading and serving it on the plaintiff constitutes notice of the pleading to all parties.


  * (2) _Notifying Parties._ A copy of every such order must be served on the parties as the court directs.


* (d) FILING.

  * (1)_Required Filings; Certificate of Service._

    * (A) _Papers after the Complaint._ Any paper after the complaint that is required to be served must be filed no later than a reasonable time after service. But disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) or (2) and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: depositions, interrogatories, requests for documents or tangible things or to permit entry onto land, and requests for admission.

    * (B) _Certificate of Service._ No certificate of service is required when a paper is served by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system. When a paper that is required to be served is served by other means:

      * (i) if the paper is filed, a certificate of service must be filed with it or within a reasonable time after service; and

      * (ii) if the paper is not filed, a certificate of service need not be filed unless filing is required by court order or by local rule.


  * (2) _Nonelectronic Filing._ A paper not filed electronically is filed by delivering it:

    * (A) to the clerk; or

    * (B) to a judge who agrees to accept it for filing, and who must then note the filing date on the paper and promptly send it to the clerk.


  * (3) _Electronic Filing and Signing._

    * (A) _By a Represented Person—Generally Required; Exceptions._ A person represented by an attorney must file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is allowed by the court for good cause or is allowed or required by local rule.

    * (B) _By an Unrepresented Person—When Allowed or Required._ A person not represented by an attorney:

      * (i) may file electronically only if allowed by court order or by local rule; and

      * (ii) may be required to file electronically only by court order, or by a local rule that includes reasonable exceptions.


    * (C) _Signing._ A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature.

    * (D) _Same as a Written Paper._ A paper filed electronically is a written paper for purposes of these rules.


  * (4) _Acceptance by the Clerk._ The clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice.

### Rule 5.1. Constitutional Challenge to a Statute—Notice, Certification, and Intervention
* (a) NOTICE BY A PARTY. A party that files a pleading, written motion, or other paper drawing into question the constitutionality of a federal or state statute must promptly:

  * (1) file a notice of constitutional question stating the question and identifying the paper that raises it, if:

    * (A) a federal statute is questioned and the parties do not include the United States, one of its agencies, or one of its officers or employees in an official capacity; or

    * (B) a state statute is questioned and the parties do not include the state, one of its agencies, or one of its officers or employees in an official capacity; and


  * (2) serve the notice and paper on the Attorney General of the United States if a federal statute is questioned—or on the state attorney general if a state statute is questioned—either by certified or registered mail or by sending it to an electronic address designated by the attorney general for this purpose.


* (b) CERTIFICATION BY THE COURT. The court must, under 28 U.S.C. §2403, certify to the appropriate attorney general that a statute has been questioned.

* (c) INTERVENTION; FINAL DECISION ON THE MERITS. Unless the court sets a later time, the attorney general may intervene within 60 days after the notice is filed or after the court certifies the challenge, whichever is earlier. Before the time to intervene expires, the court may reject the constitutional challenge, but may not enter a final judgment holding the statute unconstitutional.

* (d) NO FORFEITURE. A party's failure to file and serve the notice, or the court's failure to certify, does not forfeit a constitutional claim or defense that is otherwise timely asserted.

### Rule 5.2. Privacy Protection For Filings Made with the Court
* (a) REDACTED FILINGS. Unless the court orders otherwise, in an electronic or paper filing with the court that contains an individual's social-security number, taxpayer-identification number, or birth date, the name of an individual known to be a minor, or a financial-account number, a party or nonparty making the filing may include only:

  * (1) the last four digits of the social-security number and taxpayer-identification number;

  * (2) the year of the individual's birth;

  * (3) the minor's initials; and

  * (4) the last four digits of the financial-account number.


* (b) EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REDACTION REQUIREMENT. The redaction requirement does not apply to the following:

  * (1) a financial-account number that identifies the property allegedly subject to forfeiture in a forfeiture proceeding;

  * (2) the record of an administrative or agency proceeding;

  * (3) the official record of a state-court proceeding;

  * (4) the record of a court or tribunal, if that record was not subject to the redaction requirement when originally filed;

  * (5) a filing covered by Rule 5.2(c) or (d); and

  * (6) a pro se filing in an action brought under 28 U.S.C. §§2241, 2254, or 2255.


* (c) LIMITATIONS ON REMOTE ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC FILES; SOCIAL-SECURITY APPEALS AND IMMIGRATION CASES. Unless the court orders otherwise, in an action for benefits under the Social Security Act, and in an action or proceeding relating to an order of removal, to relief from removal, or to immigration benefits or detention, access to an electronic file is authorized as follows:

  * (1) the parties and their attorneys may have remote electronic access to any part of the case file, including the administrative record;

  * (2) any other person may have electronic access to the full record at the courthouse, but may have remote electronic access only to:

    * (A) the docket maintained by the court; and

    * (B) an opinion, order, judgment, or other disposition of the court, but not any other part of the case file or the administrative record.


* (d) FILINGS MADE UNDER SEAL. The court may order that a filing be made under seal without redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing to file a redacted version for the public record.

* (e) PROTECTIVE ORDERS. For good cause, the court may by order in a case:

  * (1) require redaction of additional information; or

  * (2) limit or prohibit a nonparty's remote electronic access to a document filed with the court.


* (f) OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL UNREDACTED FILING UNDER SEAL. A person making a redacted filing may also file an unredacted copy under seal. The court must retain the unredacted copy as part of the record.

* (g) OPTION FOR FILING A REFERENCE LIST. A filing that contains redacted information may be filed together with a reference list that identifies each item of redacted information and specifies an appropriate identifier that uniquely corresponds to each item listed. The list must be filed under seal and may be amended as of right. Any reference in the case to a listed identifier will be construed to refer to the corresponding item of information.

* (h) WAIVER OF PROTECTION OF IDENTIFIERS. A person waives the protection of Rule 5.2(a) as to the person's own information by filing it without redaction and not under seal.

### Rule 6. Computing and Extending Time; Time for Motion Papers
* (a) COMPUTING TIME. The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time.

  * (1) _Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit._ When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time:

    * (A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;

    * (B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and

    * (C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (2) _Period Stated in Hours._ When the period is stated in hours:

    * (A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;

    * (B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and

    * (C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (3) _Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office._ Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:

    * (A) on the last day for filing under Rule 6(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or

    * (B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 6(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (4) _"Last Day" Defined._ Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:

    * (A) for electronic filing, at midnight in the court's time zone; and

    * (B) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is scheduled to close.


  * (5) _"Next Day" Defined._ The "next day" is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.

  * (6) _"Legal Holiday" Defined._ "Legal holiday" means:

    * (A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;

    * (B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress; and

    * (C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a holiday by the state where the district court is located.


* (b) EXTENDING TIME.

  * (1) _In General._ When an act may or must be done within a specified time, the court may, for good cause, extend the time:

    * (A) with or without motion or notice if the court acts, or if a request is made, before the original time or its extension expires; or

    * (B) on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.


  * (2) _Exceptions._ A court must not extend the time to act under Rules 50(b) and (d), 52(b), 59(b), (d), and (e), and 60(b).


* (c) MOTIONS, NOTICES OF HEARING, AND AFFIDAVITS.

  * (1) _In General._ A written motion and notice of the hearing must be served at least 14 days before the time specified for the hearing, with the following exceptions:

    * (A) when the motion may be heard ex parte;

    * (B) when these rules set a different time; or

    * (C) when a court order—which a party may, for good cause, apply for ex parte—sets a different time.


  * (2) _Supporting Affidavit._ Any affidavit supporting a motion must be served with the motion. Except as Rule 59(c) provides otherwise, any opposing affidavit must be served at least 7 days before the hearing, unless the court permits service at another time.


* (d) ADDITIONAL TIME AFTER CERTAIN KINDS OF SERVICE. When a party may or must act within a specified time after being served and service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(C) (mail), (D) (leaving with the clerk), or (F) (other means consented to), 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a).
