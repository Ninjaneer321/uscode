### TITLE III. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

### Rule 7. Pleadings Allowed; Form of Motions and Other Papers
* (a) PLEADINGS. Only these pleadings are allowed:

  * (1) a complaint;

  * (2) an answer to a complaint;

  * (3) an answer to a counterclaim designated as a counterclaim;

  * (4) an answer to a crossclaim;

  * (5) a third-party complaint;

  * (6) an answer to a third-party complaint; and

  * (7) if the court orders one, a reply to an answer.


* (b) MOTIONS AND OTHER PAPERS.

  * (1) _In General._ A request for a court order must be made by motion. The motion must:

    * (A) be in writing unless made during a hearing or trial;

    * (B) state with particularity the grounds for seeking the order; and

    * (C) state the relief sought.


  * (2) _Form._ The rules governing captions and other matters of form in pleadings apply to motions and other papers.

### Rule 7.1. Disclosure Statement
* (a) WHO MUST FILE; CONTENTS. A nongovernmental corporate party must file 2 copies of a disclosure statement that:

  * (1) identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation owning 10% or more of its stock; or

  * (2) states that there is no such corporation.


* (b) TIME TO FILE; SUPPLEMENTAL FILING. A party must:

  * (1) file the disclosure statement with its first appearance, pleading, petition, motion, response, or other request addressed to the court; and

  * (2) promptly file a supplemental statement if any required information changes.

### Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading
* (a) CLAIM FOR RELIEF. A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain:

  * (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court's jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new jurisdictional support;

  * (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief; and

  * (3) a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the alternative or different types of relief.


* (b) DEFENSES; ADMISSIONS AND DENIALS.

  * (1) _In General._ In responding to a pleading, a party must:

    * (A) state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted against it; and

    * (B) admit or deny the allegations asserted against it by an opposing party.


  * (2) _Denials—Responding to the Substance._ A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.

  * (3) _General and Specific Denials._ A party that intends in good faith to deny all the allegations of a pleading—including the jurisdictional grounds—may do so by a general denial. A party that does not intend to deny all the allegations must either specifically deny designated allegations or generally deny all except those specifically admitted.

  * (4) _Denying Part of an Allegation._ A party that intends in good faith to deny only part of an allegation must admit the part that is true and deny the rest.

  * (5) _Lacking Knowledge or Information._ A party that lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation must so state, and the statement has the effect of a denial.

  * (6) _Effect of Failing to Deny._ An allegation—other than one relating to the amount of damages—is admitted if a responsive pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a responsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered denied or avoided.


* (c) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.

  * (1) _In General._ In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including:

    * • accord and satisfaction;

    * • arbitration and award;

    * • assumption of risk;

    * • contributory negligence;

    * • duress;

    * • estoppel;

    * • failure of consideration;

    * • fraud;

    * • illegality;

    * • injury by fellow servant;

    * • laches;

    * • license;

    * • payment;

    * • release;

    * • res judicata;

    * • statute of frauds;

    * • statute of limitations; and

    * • waiver.


  * (2) _Mistaken Designation._ If a party mistakenly designates a defense as a counterclaim, or a counterclaim as a defense, the court must, if justice requires, treat the pleading as though it were correctly designated, and may impose terms for doing so.


* (d) PLEADING TO BE CONCISE AND DIRECT; ALTERNATIVE STATEMENTS; INCONSISTENCY.

  * (1) _In General._ Each allegation must be simple, concise, and direct. No technical form is required.

  * (2) _Alternative Statements of a Claim or Defense._ A party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.

  * (3) _Inconsistent Claims or Defenses._ A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.


* (e) CONSTRUING PLEADINGS. Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice.

### Rule 9. Pleading Special Matters
* (a) CAPACITY OR AUTHORITY TO SUE; LEGAL EXISTENCE.

  * (1) _In General._ Except when required to show that the court has jurisdiction, a pleading need not allege:

    * (A) a party's capacity to sue or be sued;

    * (B) a party's authority to sue or be sued in a representative capacity; or

    * (C) the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party.


  * (2) _Raising Those Issues._ To raise any of those issues, a party must do so by a specific denial, which must state any supporting facts that are peculiarly within the party's knowledge.


* (b) FRAUD OR MISTAKE; CONDITIONS OF MIND. In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.

* (c) CONDITIONS PRECEDENT. In pleading conditions precedent, it suffices to allege generally that all conditions precedent have occurred or been performed. But when denying that a condition precedent has occurred or been performed, a party must do so with particularity.

* (d) OFFICIAL DOCUMENT OR ACT. In pleading an official document or official act, it suffices to allege that the document was legally issued or the act legally done.

* (e) JUDGMENT. In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or foreign court, a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or a board or officer, it suffices to plead the judgment or decision without showing jurisdiction to render it.

* (f) TIME AND PLACE. An allegation of time or place is material when testing the sufficiency of a pleading.

* (g) SPECIAL DAMAGES. If an item of special damage is claimed, it must be specifically stated.

* (h) ADMIRALTY OR MARITIME CLAIM.

  * (1) _How Designated._ If a claim for relief is within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction and also within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction on some other ground, the pleading may designate the claim as an admiralty or maritime claim for purposes of Rules 14(c), 38(e), and 82 and the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions. A claim cognizable only in the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction is an admiralty or maritime claim for those purposes, whether or not so designated.

  * (2) _Designation for Appeal._ A case that includes an admiralty or maritime claim within this subdivision (h) is an admiralty case within 28 U.S.C. §1292(a)(3).

### Rule 10. Form of Pleadings
* (a) CAPTION; NAMES OF PARTIES. Every pleading must have a caption with the court's name, a title, a file number, and a Rule 7(a) designation. The title of the complaint must name all the parties; the title of other pleadings, after naming the first party on each side, may refer generally to other parties.

* (b) PARAGRAPHS; SEPARATE STATEMENTS. A party must state its claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances. A later pleading may refer by number to a paragraph in an earlier pleading. If doing so would promote clarity, each claim founded on a separate transaction or occurrence—and each defense other than a denial—must be stated in a separate count or defense.

* (c) ADOPTION BY REFERENCE; EXHIBITS. A statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference elsewhere in the same pleading or in any other pleading or motion. A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.

### Rule 11. Signing Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Representations to the Court; Sanctions
* (a) SIGNATURE. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney's or party's attention.

* (b) REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:

  * (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;

  * (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;

  * (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and

  * (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.


* (c) SANCTIONS.

  * (1) _In General._ If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is responsible for the violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm must be held jointly responsible for a violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee.

  * (2) _Motion for Sanctions._ A motion for sanctions must be made separately from any other motion and must describe the specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b). The motion must be served under Rule 5, but it must not be filed or be presented to the court if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets. If warranted, the court may award to the prevailing party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred for the motion.

  * (3) _On the Court's Initiative._ On its own, the court may order an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why conduct specifically described in the order has not violated Rule 11(b).

  * (4) _Nature of a Sanction._ A sanction imposed under this rule must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. The sanction may include nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation.

  * (5) _Limitations on Monetary Sanctions._ The court must not impose a monetary sanction:

    * (A) against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b)(2); or

    * (B) on its own, unless it issued the show-cause order under Rule 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party that is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.


  * (6) _Requirements for an Order._ An order imposing a sanction must describe the sanctioned conduct and explain the basis for the sanction.


* (d) INAPPLICABILITY TO DISCOVERY. This rule does not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions under Rules 26 through 37.

### Rule 12. Defenses and Objections: When and How Presented; Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings; Consolidating Motions; Waiving Defenses; Pretrial Hearing
* (a) TIME TO SERVE A RESPONSIVE PLEADING.

  * (1) _In General._ Unless another time is specified by this rule or a federal statute, the time for serving a responsive pleading is as follows:

    * (A) A defendant must serve an answer:

      * (i) within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint; or

      * (ii) if it has timely waived service under Rule 4(d), within 60 days after the request for a waiver was sent, or within 90 days after it was sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States.


    * (B) A party must serve an answer to a counterclaim or crossclaim within 21 days after being served with the pleading that states the counterclaim or crossclaim.

    * (C) A party must serve a reply to an answer within 21 days after being served with an order to reply, unless the order specifies a different time.


  * (2) _United States and Its Agencies, Officers, or Employees Sued in an Official Capacity._ The United States, a United States agency, or a United States officer or employee sued only in an official capacity must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the United States attorney.

  * (3) _United States Officers or Employees Sued in an Individual Capacity._ A United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States' behalf must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the officer or employee or service on the United States attorney, whichever is later.

  * (4) _Effect of a Motion._ Unless the court sets a different time, serving a motion under this rule alters these periods as follows:

    * (A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until trial, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after notice of the court's action; or

    * (B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after the more definite statement is served.


* (b) HOW TO PRESENT DEFENSES. Every defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one is required. But a party may assert the following defenses by motion:

  * (1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction;

  * (2) lack of personal jurisdiction;

  * (3) improper venue;

  * (4) insufficient process;

  * (5) insufficient service of process;

  * (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and

  * (7) failure to join a party under Rule 19.


* A motion asserting any of these defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed. If a pleading sets out a claim for relief that does not require a responsive pleading, an opposing party may assert at trial any defense to that claim. No defense or objection is waived by joining it with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or in a motion.


* (c) MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS. After the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.

* (d) RESULT OF PRESENTING MATTERS OUTSIDE THE PLEADINGS. If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.

* (e) MOTION FOR A MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT. A party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response. The motion must be made before filing a responsive pleading and must point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the court orders a more definite statement and the order is not obeyed within 14 days after notice of the order or within the time the court sets, the court may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate order.

* (f) MOTION TO STRIKE. The court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. The court may act:

  * (1) on its own; or

  * (2) on motion made by a party either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being served with the pleading.


* (g) JOINING MOTIONS.

  * (1) _Right to Join._ A motion under this rule may be joined with any other motion allowed by this rule.

  * (2) _Limitation on Further Motions._ Except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.


* (h) WAIVING AND PRESERVING CERTAIN DEFENSES.

  * (1) _When Some Are Waived._ A party waives any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(2)–(5) by:

    * (A) omitting it from a motion in the circumstances described in Rule 12(g)(2); or

    * (B) failing to either:

      * (i) make it by motion under this rule; or

      * (ii) include it in a responsive pleading or in an amendment allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course.


  * (2) _When to Raise Others._ Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, to join a person required by Rule 19(b), or to state a legal defense to a claim may be raised:

    * (A) in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a);

    * (B) by a motion under Rule 12(c); or

    * (C) at trial.


  * (3) _Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction._ If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.


* (i) HEARING BEFORE TRIAL. If a party so moves, any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(1)–(7)—whether made in a pleading or by motion—and a motion under Rule 12(c) must be heard and decided before trial unless the court orders a deferral until trial.

### Rule 13. Counterclaim and Crossclaim
* (a) COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM.

  * (1) _In General._ A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that—at the time of its service—the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim:

    * (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim; and

    * (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.


  * (2) _Exceptions._ The pleader need not state the claim if:

    * (A) when the action was commenced, the claim was the subject of another pending action; or

    * (B) the opposing party sued on its claim by attachment or other process that did not establish personal jurisdiction over the pleader on that claim, and the pleader does not assert any counterclaim under this rule.


* (b) PERMISSIVE COUNTERCLAIM. A pleading may state as a counterclaim against an opposing party any claim that is not compulsory.

* (c) RELIEF SOUGHT IN A COUNTERCLAIM. A counterclaim need not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may request relief that exceeds in amount or differs in kind from the relief sought by the opposing party.

* (d) COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. These rules do not expand the right to assert a counterclaim—or to claim a credit—against the United States or a United States officer or agency.

* (e) COUNTERCLAIM MATURING OR ACQUIRED AFTER PLEADING. The court may permit a party to file a supplemental pleading asserting a counterclaim that matured or was acquired by the party after serving an earlier pleading.

* (f) [ABROGATED.]

* (g) CROSSCLAIM AGAINST A COPARTY. A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the crossclaimant.

* (h) JOINING ADDITIONAL PARTIES. Rules 19 and 20 govern the addition of a person as a party to a counterclaim or crossclaim.

* (i) SEPARATE TRIALS; SEPARATE JUDGMENTS. If the court orders separate trials under Rule 42(b), it may enter judgment on a counterclaim or crossclaim under Rule 54(b) when it has jurisdiction to do so, even if the opposing party's claims have been dismissed or otherwise resolved.

### Rule 14. Third-Party Practice
* (a) WHEN A DEFENDING PARTY MAY BRING IN A THIRD PARTY.

  * (1) _Timing of the Summons and Complaint._ A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it for all or part of the claim against it. But the third-party plaintiff must, by motion, obtain the court's leave if it files the third-party complaint more than 14 days after serving its original answer.

  * (2) _Third-Party Defendant's Claims and Defenses._ The person served with the summons and third-party complaint—the "third-party defendant":

    * (A) must assert any defense against the third-party plaintiff's claim under Rule 12;

    * (B) must assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim against another third-party defendant under Rule 13(g);

    * (C) may assert against the plaintiff any defense that the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff's claim; and

    * (D) may also assert against the plaintiff any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff.


  * (3) _Plaintiff's Claims Against a Third-Party Defendant._ The plaintiff may assert against the third-party defendant any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The third-party defendant must then assert any defense under Rule 12 and any counterclaim under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim under Rule 13(g).

  * (4) _Motion to Strike, Sever, or Try Separately._ Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, to sever it, or to try it separately.

  * (5) _Third-Party Defendant's Claim Against a Nonparty._ A third-party defendant may proceed under this rule against a nonparty who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of any claim against it.

  * (6) _Third-Party Complaint In Rem._ If it is within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, a third-party complaint may be in rem. In that event, a reference in this rule to the "summons" includes the warrant of arrest, and a reference to the defendant or third-party plaintiff includes, when appropriate, a person who asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) in the property arrested.


* (b) WHEN A PLAINTIFF MAY BRING IN A THIRD PARTY. When a claim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring in a third party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so.

* (c) ADMIRALTY OR MARITIME CLAIM.

  * (1) _Scope of Impleader._ If a plaintiff asserts an admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h), the defendant or a person who asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) may, as a third-party plaintiff, bring in a third-party defendant who may be wholly or partly liable—either to the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff— for remedy over, contribution, or otherwise on account of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.

  * (2) _Defending Against a Demand for Judgment for the Plaintiff._ The third-party plaintiff may demand judgment in the plaintiff's favor against the third-party defendant. In that event, the third-party defendant must defend under Rule 12 against the plaintiff's claim as well as the third-party plaintiff's claim; and the action proceeds as if the plaintiff had sued both the third-party defendant and the third-party plaintiff.

### Rule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings
* (a) AMENDMENTS BEFORE TRIAL.

  * (1) _Amending as a Matter of Course._ A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within:

    * (A) 21 days after serving it, or

    * (B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.


  * (2) _Other Amendments._ In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.

  * (3) _Time to Respond._ Unless the court orders otherwise, any required response to an amended pleading must be made within the time remaining to respond to the original pleading or within 14 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever is later.


* (b) AMENDMENTS DURING AND AFTER TRIAL.

  * (1) _Based on an Objection at Trial._ If, at trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party's action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence.

  * (2) _For Issues Tried by Consent._ When an issue not raised by the pleadings is tried by the parties' express or implied consent, it must be treated in all respects as if raised in the pleadings. A party may move—at any time, even after judgment—to amend the pleadings to conform them to the evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue. But failure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of that issue.


* (c) RELATION BACK OF AMENDMENTS.

  * (1) _When an Amendment Relates Back._ An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:

    * (A) the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back;

    * (B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading; or

    * (C) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:

      * (i) received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and

      * (ii) knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.


  * (2) _Notice to the United States._ When the United States or a United States officer or agency is added as a defendant by amendment, the notice requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and (ii) are satisfied if, during the stated period, process was delivered or mailed to the United States attorney or the United States attorney's designee, to the Attorney General of the United States, or to the officer or agency.


* (d) SUPPLEMENTAL PLEADINGS. On motion and reasonable notice, the court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented. The court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense. The court may order that the opposing party plead to the supplemental pleading within a specified time.

### Rule 16. Pretrial Conferences; Scheduling; Management
* (a) PURPOSES OF A PRETRIAL CONFERENCE. In any action, the court may order the attorneys and any unrepresented parties to appear for one or more pretrial conferences for such purposes as:

  * (1) expediting disposition of the action;

  * (2) establishing early and continuing control so that the case will not be protracted because of lack of management;

  * (3) discouraging wasteful pretrial activities;

  * (4) improving the quality of the trial through more thorough preparation; and

  * (5) facilitating settlement.


* (b) SCHEDULING.

  * (1) _Scheduling Order._ Except in categories of actions exempted by local rule, the district judge—or a magistrate judge when authorized by local rule—must issue a scheduling order:

    * (A) after receiving the parties' report under Rule 26(f); or

    * (B) after consulting with the parties' attorneys and any unrepresented parties at a scheduling conference.


  * (2) _Time to Issue._ The judge must issue the scheduling order as soon as practicable, but unless the judge finds good cause for delay, the judge must issue it within the earlier of 90 days after any defendant has been served with the complaint or 60 days after any defendant has appeared.

  * (3) _Contents of the Order._

    * (A) _Required Contents._ The scheduling order must limit the time to join other parties, amend the pleadings, complete discovery, and file motions.

    * (B) _Permitted Contents._ The scheduling order may:

      * (i) modify the timing of disclosures under Rules 26(a) and 26(e)(1);

      * (ii) modify the extent of discovery;

      * (iii) provide for disclosure, discovery, or preservation of electronically stored information;

      * (iv) include any agreements the parties reach for asserting claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material after information is produced, including agreements reached under Federal Rule of Evidence 502;

      * (v) direct that before moving for an order relating to discovery, the movant must request a conference with the court;

      * (vi) set dates for pretrial conferences and for trial; and

      * (vii) include other appropriate matters.


  * (4) _Modifying a Schedule._ A schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge's consent.


* (c) ATTENDANCE AND MATTERS FOR CONSIDERATION AT A PRETRIAL CONFERENCE.

  * (1) _Attendance._ A represented party must authorize at least one of its attorneys to make stipulations and admissions about all matters that can reasonably be anticipated for discussion at a pretrial conference. If appropriate, the court may require that a party or its representative be present or reasonably available by other means to consider possible settlement.

  * (2) _Matters for Consideration._ At any pretrial conference, the court may consider and take appropriate action on the following matters:

    * (A) formulating and simplifying the issues, and eliminating frivolous claims or defenses;

    * (B) amending the pleadings if necessary or desirable;

    * (C) obtaining admissions and stipulations about facts and documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and ruling in advance on the admissibility of evidence;

    * (D) avoiding unnecessary proof and cumulative evidence, and limiting the use of testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702;

    * (E) determining the appropriateness and timing of summary adjudication under Rule 56;

    * (F) controlling and scheduling discovery, including orders affecting disclosures and discovery under Rule 26 and Rules 29 through 37;

    * (G) identifying witnesses and documents, scheduling the filing and exchange of any pretrial briefs, and setting dates for further conferences and for trial;

    * (H) referring matters to a magistrate judge or a master;

    * (I) settling the case and using special procedures to assist in resolving the dispute when authorized by statute or local rule;

    * (J) determining the form and content of the pretrial order;

    * (K) disposing of pending motions;

    * (L) adopting special procedures for managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or unusual proof problems;

    * (M) ordering a separate trial under Rule 42(b) of a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, third-party claim, or particular issue;

    * (N) ordering the presentation of evidence early in the trial on a manageable issue that might, on the evidence, be the basis for a judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) or a judgment on partial findings under Rule 52(c);

    * (O) establishing a reasonable limit on the time allowed to present evidence; and

    * (P) facilitating in other ways the just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition of the action.


* (d) PRETRIAL ORDERS. After any conference under this rule, the court should issue an order reciting the action taken. This order controls the course of the action unless the court modifies it.

* (e) FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE AND ORDERS. The court may hold a final pretrial conference to formulate a trial plan, including a plan to facilitate the admission of evidence. The conference must be held as close to the start of trial as is reasonable, and must be attended by at least one attorney who will conduct the trial for each party and by any unrepresented party. The court may modify the order issued after a final pretrial conference only to prevent manifest injustice.

* (f) SANCTIONS.

  * (1) _In General._ On motion or on its own, the court may issue any just orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii), if a party or its attorney:

    * (A) fails to appear at a scheduling or other pretrial conference;

    * (B) is substantially unprepared to participate—or does not participate in good faith—in the conference; or

    * (C) fails to obey a scheduling or other pretrial order.


  * (2) _Imposing Fees and Costs._ Instead of or in addition to any other sanction, the court must order the party, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable expenses—including attorney's fees—incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, unless the noncompliance was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
