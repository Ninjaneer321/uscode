### TITLE IX. SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS

### Rule 71.1. Condemning Real or Personal Property
* (a) APPLICABILITY OF OTHER RULES. These rules govern proceedings to condemn real and personal property by eminent domain, except as this rule provides otherwise.

* (b) JOINDER OF PROPERTIES. The plaintiff may join separate pieces of property in a single action, no matter whether they are owned by the same persons or sought for the same use.

* (c) COMPLAINT.

  * (1) _Caption._ The complaint must contain a caption as provided in Rule 10(a). The plaintiff must, however, name as defendants both the property—designated generally by kind, quantity, and location—and at least one owner of some part of or interest in the property.

  * (2) _Contents._ The complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the following:

    * (A) the authority for the taking;

    * (B) the uses for which the property is to be taken;

    * (C) a description sufficient to identify the property;

    * (D) the interests to be acquired; and

    * (E) for each piece of property, a designation of each defendant who has been joined as an owner or owner of an interest in it.


  * (3) _Parties._ When the action commences, the plaintiff need join as defendants only those persons who have or claim an interest in the property and whose names are then known. But before any hearing on compensation, the plaintiff must add as defendants all those persons who have or claim an interest and whose names have become known or can be found by a reasonably diligent search of the records, considering both the property's character and value and the interests to be acquired. All others may be made defendants under the designation "Unknown Owners."

  * (4) _Procedure._ Notice must be served on all defendants as provided in Rule 71.1(d), whether they were named as defendants when the action commenced or were added later. A defendant may answer as provided in Rule 71.1(e). The court, meanwhile, may order any distribution of a deposit that the facts warrant.

  * (5) _Filing; Additional Copies._ In addition to filing the complaint, the plaintiff must give the clerk at least one copy for the defendants' use and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant.


* (d) PROCESS.

  * (1) _Delivering Notice to the Clerk._ On filing a complaint, the plaintiff must promptly deliver to the clerk joint or several notices directed to the named defendants. When adding defendants, the plaintiff must deliver to the clerk additional notices directed to the new defendants.

  * (2) _Contents of the Notice._

    * (A) _Main Contents._ Each notice must name the court, the title of the action, and the defendant to whom it is directed. It must describe the property sufficiently to identify it, but need not describe any property other than that to be taken from the named defendant. The notice must also state:

      * (i) that the action is to condemn property;

      * (ii) the interest to be taken;

      * (iii) the authority for the taking;

      * (iv) the uses for which the property is to be taken;

      * (v) that the defendant may serve an answer on the plaintiff's attorney within 21 days after being served with the notice;

      * (vi) that the failure to so serve an answer constitutes consent to the taking and to the court's authority to proceed with the action and fix the compensation; and

      * (vii) that a defendant who does not serve an answer may file a notice of appearance.


    * (B) _Conclusion._ The notice must conclude with the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of the plaintiff's attorney and an address within the district in which the action is brought where the attorney may be served.


  * (3) _Serving the Notice._

    * (A) _Personal Service._ When a defendant whose address is known resides within the United States or a territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States, personal service of the notice (without a copy of the complaint) must be made in accordance with Rule 4.

    * (B) _Service by Publication._

      * (i) A defendant may be served by publication only when the plaintiff's attorney files a certificate stating that the attorney believes the defendant cannot be personally served, because after diligent inquiry within the state where the complaint is filed, the defendant's place of residence is still unknown or, if known, that it is beyond the territorial limits of personal service. Service is then made by publishing the notice—once a week for at least 3 successive weeks—in a newspaper published in the county where the property is located or, if there is no such newspaper, in a newspaper with general circulation where the property is located. Before the last publication, a copy of the notice must also be mailed to every defendant who cannot be personally served but whose place of residence is then known. Unknown owners may be served by publication in the same manner by a notice addressed to "Unknown Owners."

      * (ii) Service by publication is complete on the date of the last publication. The plaintiff's attorney must prove publication and mailing by a certificate, attach a printed copy of the published notice, and mark on the copy the newspaper's name and the dates of publication.


  * (4) _Effect of Delivery and Service._ Delivering the notice to the clerk and serving it have the same effect as serving a summons under Rule 4.

  * (5) _Amending the Notice; Proof of Service and Amending the Proof._ Rule 4(a)(2) governs amending the notice. Rule 4(l) governs proof of service and amending it.


* (e) APPEARANCE OR ANSWER.

  * (1) _Notice of Appearance._ A defendant that has no objection or defense to the taking of its property may serve a notice of appearance designating the property in which it claims an interest. The defendant must then be given notice of all later proceedings affecting the defendant.

  * (2) _Answer._ A defendant that has an objection or defense to the taking must serve an answer within 21 days after being served with the notice. The answer must:

    * (A) identify the property in which the defendant claims an interest;

    * (B) state the nature and extent of the interest; and

    * (C) state all the defendant's objections and defenses to the taking.


  * (3) _Waiver of Other Objections and Defenses; Evidence on Compensation._ A defendant waives all objections and defenses not stated in its answer. No other pleading or motion asserting an additional objection or defense is allowed. But at the trial on compensation, a defendant—whether or not it has previously appeared or answered—may present evidence on the amount of compensation to be paid and may share in the award.


* (f) AMENDING PLEADINGS. Without leave of court, the plaintiff may—as often as it wants—amend the complaint at any time before the trial on compensation. But no amendment may be made if it would result in a dismissal inconsistent with Rule 71.1(i)(1) or (2). The plaintiff need not serve a copy of an amendment, but must serve notice of the filing, as provided in Rule 5(b), on every affected party who has appeared and, as provided in Rule 71.1(d), on every affected party who has not appeared. In addition, the plaintiff must give the clerk at least one copy of each amendment for the defendants' use, and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant. A defendant may appear or answer in the time and manner and with the same effect as provided in Rule 71.1(e).

* (g) SUBSTITUTING PARTIES. If a defendant dies, becomes incompetent, or transfers an interest after being joined, the court may, on motion and notice of hearing, order that the proper party be substituted. Service of the motion and notice on a nonparty must be made as provided in Rule 71.1(d)(3).

* (h) TRIAL OF THE ISSUES.

  * (1) _Issues Other Than Compensation; Compensation._ In an action involving eminent domain under federal law, the court tries all issues, including compensation, except when compensation must be determined:

    * (A) by any tribunal specially constituted by a federal statute to determine compensation; or

    * (B) if there is no such tribunal, by a jury when a party demands one within the time to answer or within any additional time the court sets, unless the court appoints a commission.


  * (2) _Appointing a Commission; Commission's Powers and Report._

    * (A) _Reasons for Appointing._ If a party has demanded a jury, the court may instead appoint a three-person commission to determine compensation because of the character, location, or quantity of the property to be condemned or for other just reasons.

    * (B) _Alternate Commissioners._ The court may appoint up to two additional persons to serve as alternate commissioners to hear the case and replace commissioners who, before a decision is filed, the court finds unable or disqualified to perform their duties. Once the commission renders its final decision, the court must discharge any alternate who has not replaced a commissioner.

    * (C) _Examining the Prospective Commissioners._ Before making its appointments, the court must advise the parties of the identity and qualifications of each prospective commissioner and alternate, and may permit the parties to examine them. The parties may not suggest appointees, but for good cause may object to a prospective commissioner or alternate.

    * (D) _Commission's Powers and Report._ A commission has the powers of a master under Rule 53(c). Its action and report are determined by a majority. Rule 53(d), (e), and (f) apply to its action and report.


* (i) DISMISSAL OF THE ACTION OR A DEFENDANT.

  * (1) _Dismissing the Action._

    * (A) _By the Plaintiff._ If no compensation hearing on a piece of property has begun, and if the plaintiff has not acquired title or a lesser interest or taken possession, the plaintiff may, without a court order, dismiss the action as to that property by filing a notice of dismissal briefly describing the property.

    * (B) _By Stipulation._ Before a judgment is entered vesting the plaintiff with title or a lesser interest in or possession of property, the plaintiff and affected defendants may, without a court order, dismiss the action in whole or in part by filing a stipulation of dismissal. And if the parties so stipulate, the court may vacate a judgment already entered.

    * (C) _By Court Order._ At any time before compensation has been determined and paid, the court may, after a motion and hearing, dismiss the action as to a piece of property. But if the plaintiff has already taken title, a lesser interest, or possession as to any part of it, the court must award compensation for the title, lesser interest, or possession taken.


  * (2) _Dismissing a Defendant._ The court may at any time dismiss a defendant who was unnecessarily or improperly joined.

  * (3) _Effect._ A dismissal is without prejudice unless otherwise stated in the notice, stipulation, or court order.


* (j) DEPOSIT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION.

  * (1) _Deposit._ The plaintiff must deposit with the court any money required by law as a condition to the exercise of eminent domain and may make a deposit when allowed by statute.

  * (2) _Distribution; Adjusting Distribution._ After a deposit, the court and attorneys must expedite the proceedings so as to distribute the deposit and to determine and pay compensation. If the compensation finally awarded to a defendant exceeds the amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment against the plaintiff for the deficiency. If the compensation awarded to a defendant is less than the amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment against that defendant for the overpayment.


* (k) CONDEMNATION UNDER A STATE'S POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. This rule governs an action involving eminent domain under state law. But if state law provides for trying an issue by jury—or for trying the issue of compensation by jury or commission or both—that law governs.

* (l) COSTS. Costs are not subject to Rule 54(d).

### Rule 72. Magistrate Judges: Pretrial Order
* (a) NONDISPOSITIVE MATTERS. When a pretrial matter not dispositive of a party's claim or defense is referred to a magistrate judge to hear and decide, the magistrate judge must promptly conduct the required proceedings and, when appropriate, issue a written order stating the decision. A party may serve and file objections to the order within 14 days after being served with a copy. A party may not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to. The district judge in the case must consider timely objections and modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.

* (b) DISPOSITIVE MOTIONS AND PRISONER PETITIONS.

  * (1) _Findings and Recommendations._ A magistrate judge must promptly conduct the required proceedings when assigned, without the parties' consent, to hear a pretrial matter dispositive of a claim or defense or a prisoner petition challenging the conditions of confinement. A record must be made of all evidentiary proceedings and may, at the magistrate judge's discretion, be made of any other proceedings. The magistrate judge must enter a recommended disposition, including, if appropriate, proposed findings of fact. The clerk must promptly mail a copy to each party.

  * (2) _Objections._ Within 14 days after being served with a copy of the recommended disposition, a party may serve and file specific written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations. A party may respond to another party's objections within 14 days after being served with a copy. Unless the district judge orders otherwise, the objecting party must promptly arrange for transcribing the record, or whatever portions of it the parties agree to or the magistrate judge considers sufficient.

  * (3) _Resolving Objections._ The district judge must determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge's disposition that has been properly objected to. The district judge may accept, reject, or modify the recommended disposition; receive further evidence; or return the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.

### Rule 73. Magistrate Judges: Trial by Consent; Appeal
* (a) TRIAL BY CONSENT. When authorized under 28 U.S.C. §636(c), a magistrate judge may, if all parties consent, conduct a civil action or proceeding, including a jury or nonjury trial. A record must be made in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §636(c)(5).

* (b) CONSENT PROCEDURE.

  * (1) _In General._ When a magistrate judge has been designated to conduct civil actions or proceedings, the clerk must give the parties written notice of their opportunity to consent under 28 U.S.C. §636(c). To signify their consent, the parties must jointly or separately file a statement consenting to the referral. A district judge or magistrate judge may be informed of a party's response to the clerk's notice only if all parties have consented to the referral.

  * (2) _Reminding the Parties About Consenting._ A district judge, magistrate judge, or other court official may remind the parties of the magistrate judge's availability, but must also advise them that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences.

  * (3) _Vacating a Referral._ On its own for good cause—or when a party shows extraordinary circumstances—the district judge may vacate a referral to a magistrate judge under this rule.


* (c) APPEALING A JUDGMENT. In accordance with 28 U.S.C. §636(c)(3), an appeal from a judgment entered at a magistrate judge's direction may be taken to the court of appeals as would any other appeal from a district-court judgment.
