### TITLE X. DISTRICT COURTS AND CLERKS: CONDUCTING BUSINESS; ISSUING ORDERS

### Rule 77. Conducting Business; Clerk's Authority; Notice of an Order or Judgment
* (a) WHEN COURT IS OPEN. Every district court is considered always open for filing any paper, issuing and returning process, making a motion, or entering an order.

* (b) PLACE FOR TRIAL AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS. Every trial on the merits must be conducted in open court and, so far as convenient, in a regular courtroom. Any other act or proceeding may be done or conducted by a judge in chambers, without the attendance of the clerk or other court official, and anywhere inside or outside the district. But no hearing—other than one ex parte—may be conducted outside the district unless all the affected parties consent.

* (c) CLERK'S OFFICE HOURS; CLERK'S ORDERS.

  * (1) _Hours._ The clerk's office—with a clerk or deputy on duty—must be open during business hours every day except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. But a court may, by local rule or order, require that the office be open for specified hours on Saturday or a particular legal holiday other than one listed in Rule 6(a)(6)(A).

  * (2) _Orders._ Subject to the court's power to suspend, alter, or rescind the clerk's action for good cause, the clerk may:

    * (A) issue process;

    * (B) enter a default;

    * (C) enter a default judgment under Rule 55(b)(1); and

    * (D) act on any other matter that does not require the court's action.


* (d) SERVING NOTICE OF AN ORDER OR JUDGMENT.

  * (1) _Service._ Immediately after entering an order or judgment, the clerk must serve notice of the entry, as provided in Rule 5(b), on each party who is not in default for failing to appear. The clerk must record the service on the docket. A party also may serve notice of the entry as provided in Rule 5(b).

  * (2) _Time to Appeal Not Affected by Lack of Notice._ Lack of notice of the entry does not affect the time for appeal or relieve—or authorize the court to relieve—a party for failing to appeal within the time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (4)(a).

### Rule 78. Hearing Motions; Submission on Briefs
* (a) PROVIDING A REGULAR SCHEDULE FOR ORAL HEARINGS. A court may establish regular times and places for oral hearings on motions.

### Rule 79. Records Kept by the Clerk
* (a) CIVIL DOCKET.

  * (1) _In General._ The clerk must keep a record known as the "civil docket" in the form and manner prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The clerk must enter each civil action in the docket. Actions must be assigned consecutive file numbers, which must be noted in the docket where the first entry of the action is made.

  * (2) _Items to be Entered._ The following items must be marked with the file number and entered chronologically in the docket:

    * (A) papers filed with the clerk;

    * (B) process issued, and proofs of service or other returns showing execution; and

    * (C) appearances, orders, verdicts, and judgments.


  * (3) _Contents of Entries; Jury Trial Demanded._ Each entry must briefly show the nature of the paper filed or writ issued, the substance of each proof of service or other return, and the substance and date of entry of each order and judgment. When a jury trial has been properly demanded or ordered, the clerk must enter the word "jury" in the docket.


* (b) CIVIL JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS. The clerk must keep a copy of every final judgment and appealable order; of every order affecting title to or a lien on real or personal property; and of any other order that the court directs to be kept. The clerk must keep these in the form and manner prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States.

* (c) INDEXES; CALENDARS. Under the court's direction, the clerk must:

  * (1) keep indexes of the docket and of the judgments and orders described in Rule 79(b); and

  * (2) prepare calendars of all actions ready for trial, distinguishing jury trials from nonjury trials.


* (d) OTHER RECORDS. The clerk must keep any other records required by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States.
