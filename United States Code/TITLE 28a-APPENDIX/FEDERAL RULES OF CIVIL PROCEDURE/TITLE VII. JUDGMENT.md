### TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

### Rule 54. Judgment; Costs
* (a) DEFINITION; FORM. "Judgment" as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment should not include recitals of pleadings, a master's report, or a record of prior proceedings.

* (b) JUDGMENT ON MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR INVOLVING MULTIPLE PARTIES. When an action presents more than one claim for relief—whether as a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim—or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay. Otherwise, any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities.

* (c) DEMAND FOR JUDGMENT; RELIEF TO BE GRANTED. A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings. Every other final judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.

* (d) COSTS; ATTORNEY'S FEES.

  * (1) _Costs Other Than Attorney's Fees._ Unless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs—other than attorney's fees—should be allowed to the prevailing party. But costs against the United States, its officers, and its agencies may be imposed only to the extent allowed by law. The clerk may tax costs on 14 days' notice. On motion served within the next 7 days, the court may review the clerk's action.

  * (2) _Attorney's Fees._

    * (A) _Claim to Be by Motion._ A claim for attorney's fees and related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion unless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages.

    * (B) _Timing and Contents of the Motion._ Unless a statute or a court order provides otherwise, the motion must:

      * (i) be filed no later than 14 days after the entry of judgment;

      * (ii) specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the movant to the award;

      * (iii) state the amount sought or provide a fair estimate of it; and

      * (iv) disclose, if the court so orders, the terms of any agreement about fees for the services for which the claim is made.


    * (C) _Proceedings._ Subject to Rule 23(h), the court must, on a party's request, give an opportunity for adversary submissions on the motion in accordance with Rule 43(c) or 78. The court may decide issues of liability for fees before receiving submissions on the value of services. The court must find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in Rule 52(a).

    * (D) _Special Procedures by Local Rule; Reference to a Master or a Magistrate Judge._ By local rule, the court may establish special procedures to resolve fee-related issues without extensive evidentiary hearings. Also, the court may refer issues concerning the value of services to a special master under Rule 53 without regard to the limitations of Rule 53(a)(1), and may refer a motion for attorney's fees to a magistrate judge under Rule 72(b) as if it were a dispositive pretrial matter.

    * (E) _Exceptions._ Subparagraphs (A)–(D) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violating these rules or as sanctions under 28 U.S.C. §1927.

### Rule 55. Default; Default Judgment
* (a) ENTERING A DEFAULT. When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk must enter the party's default.

* (b) ENTERING A DEFAULT JUDGMENT.

  * (1) _By the Clerk._ If the plaintiff's claim is for a sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation, the clerk—on the plaintiff's request, with an affidavit showing the amount due—must enter judgment for that amount and costs against a defendant who has been defaulted for not appearing and who is neither a minor nor an incompetent person.

  * (2) _By the Court._ In all other cases, the party must apply to the court for a default judgment. A default judgment may be entered against a minor or incompetent person only if represented by a general guardian, conservator, or other like fiduciary who has appeared. If the party against whom a default judgment is sought has appeared personally or by a representative, that party or its representative must be served with written notice of the application at least 7 days before the hearing. The court may conduct hearings or make referrals—preserving any federal statutory right to a jury trial—when, to enter or effectuate judgment, it needs to:

    * (A) conduct an accounting;

    * (B) determine the amount of damages;

    * (C) establish the truth of any allegation by evidence; or

    * (D) investigate any other matter.


* (c) SETTING ASIDE A DEFAULT OR A DEFAULT JUDGMENT. The court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and it may set aside a final default judgment under Rule 60(b).

* (d) JUDGMENT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. A default judgment may be entered against the United States, its officers, or its agencies only if the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence that satisfies the court.

### Rule 56. Summary Judgment
* (a) MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT. A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion.

* (b) TIME TO FILE A MOTION. Unless a different time is set by local rule or the court orders otherwise, a party may file a motion for summary judgment at any time until 30 days after the close of all discovery.

* (c) PROCEDURES.

  * (1) _Supporting Factual Positions._ A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:

    * (A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or

    * (B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.


  * (2) _Objection That a Fact Is Not Supported by Admissible Evidence._ A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.

  * (3) _Materials Not Cited._ The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.

  * (4) _Affidavits or Declarations._ An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.


* (d) WHEN FACTS ARE UNAVAILABLE TO THE NONMOVANT. If a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:

  * (1) defer considering the motion or deny it;

  * (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or

  * (3) issue any other appropriate order.


* (e) FAILING TO PROPERLY SUPPORT OR ADDRESS A FACT. If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may:

  * (1) give an opportunity to properly support or address the fact;

  * (2) consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion;

  * (3) grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials—including the facts considered undisputed—show that the movant is entitled to it; or

  * (4) issue any other appropriate order.


* (f) JUDGMENT INDEPENDENT OF THE MOTION. After giving notice and a reasonable time to respond, the court may:

  * (1) grant summary judgment for a nonmovant;

  * (2) grant the motion on grounds not raised by a party; or

  * (3) consider summary judgment on its own after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute.


* (g) FAILING TO GRANT ALL THE REQUESTED RELIEF. If the court does not grant all the relief requested by the motion, it may enter an order stating any material fact—including an item of damages or other relief—that is not genuinely in dispute and treating the fact as established in the case.

* (h) AFFIDAVIT OR DECLARATION SUBMITTED IN BAD FAITH. If satisfied that an affidavit or declaration under this rule is submitted in bad faith or solely for delay, the court—after notice and a reasonable time to respond—may order the submitting party to pay the other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, it incurred as a result. An offending party or attorney may also be held in contempt or subjected to other appropriate sanctions.

### Rule 57. Declaratory Judgment
* These rules govern the procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. §2201. Rules 38 and 39 govern a demand for a jury trial. The existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate. The court may order a speedy hearing of a declaratory-judgment action.

### Rule 58. Entering Judgment
* (a) SEPARATE DOCUMENT. Every judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document, but a separate document is not required for an order disposing of a motion:

  * (1) for judgment under Rule 50(b);

  * (2) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 52(b);

  * (3) for attorney's fees under Rule 54;

  * (4) for a new trial, or to alter or amend the judgment, under Rule 59; or

  * (5) for relief under Rule 60.


* (b) ENTERING JUDGMENT.

  * (1) _Without the Court's Direction._ Subject to Rule 54(b) and unless the court orders otherwise, the clerk must, without awaiting the court's direction, promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment when:

    * (A) the jury returns a general verdict;

    * (B) the court awards only costs or a sum certain; or

    * (C) the court denies all relief.


  * (2) _Court's Approval Required._ Subject to Rule 54(b), the court must promptly approve the form of the judgment, which the clerk must promptly enter, when:

    * (A) the jury returns a special verdict or a general verdict with answers to written questions; or

    * (B) the court grants other relief not described in this subdivision (b).


* (c) TIME OF ENTRY. For purposes of these rules, judgment is entered at the following times:

  * (1) if a separate document is not required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a); or

  * (2) if a separate document is required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a) and the earlier of these events occurs:

    * (A) it is set out in a separate document; or

    * (B) 150 days have run from the entry in the civil docket.


* (d) REQUEST FOR ENTRY. A party may request that judgment be set out in a separate document as required by Rule 58(a).

* (e) COST OR FEE AWARDS. Ordinarily, the entry of judgment may not be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. But if a timely motion for attorney's fees is made under Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and become effective to order that the motion have the same effect under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) as a timely motion under Rule 59.

### Rule 59. New Trial; Altering or Amending a Judgment
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Grounds for New Trial._ The court may, on motion, grant a new trial on all or some of the issues—and to any party—as follows:

    * (A) after a jury trial, for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court; or

    * (B) after a nonjury trial, for any reason for which a rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in federal court.


  * (2) _Further Action After a Nonjury Trial._ After a nonjury trial, the court may, on motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and direct the entry of a new judgment.


* (b) TIME TO FILE A MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL. A motion for a new trial must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment.

* (c) TIME TO SERVE AFFIDAVITS. When a motion for a new trial is based on affidavits, they must be filed with the motion. The opposing party has 14 days after being served to file opposing affidavits. The court may permit reply affidavits.

* (d) NEW TRIAL ON THE COURT'S INITIATIVE OR FOR REASONS NOT IN THE MOTION. No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the court, on its own, may order a new trial for any reason that would justify granting one on a party's motion. After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion. In either event, the court must specify the reasons in its order.

* (e) MOTION TO ALTER OR AMEND A JUDGMENT. A motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.

### Rule 60. Relief from a Judgment or Order
* (a) CORRECTIONS BASED ON CLERICAL MISTAKES; OVERSIGHTS AND OMISSIONS. The court may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record. The court may do so on motion or on its own, with or without notice. But after an appeal has been docketed in the appellate court and while it is pending, such a mistake may be corrected only with the appellate court's leave.

* (b) GROUNDS FOR RELIEF FROM A FINAL JUDGMENT, ORDER, OR PROCEEDING. On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:

  * (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;

  * (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);

  * (3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;

  * (4) the judgment is void;

  * (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or

  * (6) any other reason that justifies relief.


* (c) TIMING AND EFFECT OF THE MOTION.

  * (1) _Timing._ A motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time—and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.

  * (2) _Effect on Finality._ The motion does not affect the judgment's finality or suspend its operation.


* (d) OTHER POWERS TO GRANT RELIEF. This rule does not limit a court's power to:

  * (1) entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding;

  * (2) grant relief under 28 U.S.C. §1655 to a defendant who was not personally notified of the action; or

  * (3) set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.


* (e) BILLS AND WRITS ABOLISHED. The following are abolished: bills of review, bills in the nature of bills of review, and writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, and audita querela.

### Rule 61. Harmless Error
* Unless justice requires otherwise, no error in admitting or excluding evidence—or any other error by the court or a party—is ground for granting a new trial, for setting aside a verdict, or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order. At every stage of the proceeding, the court must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party's substantial rights.

### Rule 62. Stay of Proceedings to Enforce a Judgment
* (a) AUTOMATIC STAY. Except as provided in Rule 62(c) and (d), execution on a judgment and proceedings to enforce it are stayed for 30 days after its entry, unless the court orders otherwise.

* (b) STAY BY BOND OR OTHER SECURITY. At any time after judgment is entered, a party may obtain a stay by providing a bond or other security. The stay takes effect when the court approves the bond or other security and remains in effect for the time specified in the bond or other security.

* (c) STAY OF AN INJUNCTION, RECEIVERSHIP, OR PATENT ACCOUNTING ORDER. Unless the court orders otherwise, the following are not stayed after being entered, even if an appeal is taken:

  * (1) an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction or receivership; or

  * (2) a judgment or order that directs an accounting in an action for patent infringement.


* (d) INJUNCTION PENDING AN APPEAL. While an appeal is pending from an interlocutory order or final judgment that grants, continues, modifies, refuses, dissolves, or refuses to dissolve or modify an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction on terms for bond or other terms that secure the opposing party's rights. If the judgment appealed from is rendered by a statutory three-judge district court, the order must be made either:

  * (1) by that court sitting in open session; or

  * (2) by the assent of all its judges, as evidenced by their signatures.


* (e) STAY WITHOUT BOND ON AN APPEAL BY THE UNITED STATES, ITS OFFICERS, OR ITS AGENCIES. The court must not require a bond, obligation, or other security from the appellant when granting a stay on an appeal by the United States, its officers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed by a department of the federal government.

* (f) STAY IN FAVOR OF A JUDGMENT DEBTOR UNDER STATE LAW. If a judgment is a lien on the judgment debtor's property under the law of the state where the court is located, the judgment debtor is entitled to the same stay of execution the state court would give.

* (g) APPELLATE COURT'S POWER NOT LIMITED. This rule does not limit the power of the appellate court or one of its judges or justices:

  * (1) to stay proceedings—or suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction—while an appeal is pending; or

  * (2) to issue an order to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment to be entered.


* (h) STAY WITH MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR PARTIES. A court may stay the enforcement of a final judgment entered under Rule 54(b) until it enters a later judgment or judgments, and may prescribe terms necessary to secure the benefit of the stayed judgment for the party in whose favor it was entered.

### Rule 62.1. Indicative Ruling on a Motion for Relief That is Barred by a Pending Appeal
* (a) RELIEF PENDING APPEAL. If a timely motion is made for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the court may:

  * (1) defer considering the motion;

  * (2) deny the motion; or

  * (3) state either that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.


* (b) NOTICE TO THE COURT OF APPEALS. The movant must promptly notify the circuit clerk under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 12.1 if the district court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

* (c) REMAND. The district court may decide the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose.

### Rule 63. Judge's Inability to Proceed
* If a judge conducting a hearing or trial is unable to proceed, any other judge may proceed upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties. In a hearing or a nonjury trial, the successor judge must, at a party's request, recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify again without undue burden. The successor judge may also recall any other witness.
