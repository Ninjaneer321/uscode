### TITLE VIII. PROVISIONAL AND FINAL REMEDIES

### Rule 64. Seizing a Person or Property
* (a) REMEDIES UNDER STATE LAW—IN GENERAL. At the commencement of and throughout an action, every remedy is available that, under the law of the state where the court is located, provides for seizing a person or property to secure satisfaction of the potential judgment. But a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.

* (b) SPECIFIC KINDS OF REMEDIES. The remedies available under this rule include the following—however designated and regardless of whether state procedure requires an independent action:

  * • arrest;

  * • attachment;

  * • garnishment;

  * • replevin;

  * • sequestration; and

  * • other corresponding or equivalent remedies.

### Rule 65. Injunctions and Restraining Orders
* (a) PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.

  * (1) _Notice._ The court may issue a preliminary injunction only on notice to the adverse party.

  * (2) _Consolidating the Hearing with the Trial on the Merits._ Before or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court may advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing. Even when consolidation is not ordered, evidence that is received on the motion and that would be admissible at trial becomes part of the trial record and need not be repeated at trial. But the court must preserve any party's right to a jury trial.


* (b) TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.

  * (1) _Issuing Without Notice._ The court may issue a temporary restraining order without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney only if:

    * (A) specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition; and

    * (B) the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.


  * (2) _Contents; Expiration._ Every temporary restraining order issued without notice must state the date and hour it was issued; describe the injury and state why it is irreparable; state why the order was issued without notice; and be promptly filed in the clerk's office and entered in the record. The order expires at the time after entry—not to exceed 14 days—that the court sets, unless before that time the court, for good cause, extends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer extension. The reasons for an extension must be entered in the record.

  * (3) _Expediting the Preliminary-Injunction Hearing._ If the order is issued without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction must be set for hearing at the earliest possible time, taking precedence over all other matters except hearings on older matters of the same character. At the hearing, the party who obtained the order must proceed with the motion; if the party does not, the court must dissolve the order.

  * (4) _Motion to Dissolve._ On 2 days' notice to the party who obtained the order without notice—or on shorter notice set by the court—the adverse party may appear and move to dissolve or modify the order. The court must then hear and decide the motion as promptly as justice requires.


* (c) SECURITY. The court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained. The United States, its officers, and its agencies are not required to give security.

* (d) CONTENTS AND SCOPE OF EVERY INJUNCTION AND RESTRAINING ORDER.

  * (1) _Contents._ Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order must:

    * (A) state the reasons why it issued;

    * (B) state its terms specifically; and

    * (C) describe in reasonable detail—and not by referring to the complaint or other document—the act or acts restrained or required.


  * (2) _Persons Bound._ The order binds only the following who receive actual notice of it by personal service or otherwise:

    * (A) the parties;

    * (B) the parties' officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys; and

    * (C) other persons who are in active concert or participation with anyone described in Rule 65(d)(2)(A) or (B).


* (e) OTHER LAWS NOT MODIFIED. These rules do not modify the following:

  * (1) any federal statute relating to temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions in actions affecting employer and employee;

  * (2) 28 U.S.C. §2361, which relates to preliminary injunctions in actions of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader; or

  * (3) 28 U.S.C. §2284, which relates to actions that must be heard and decided by a three-judge district court.


* (f) COPYRIGHT IMPOUNDMENT. This rule applies to copyright-impoundment proceedings.

### Rule 65.1. Proceedings Against a Security Provider
* Whenever these rules (including the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions) require or allow a party to give security, and security is given with one or more security providers, each provider submits to the court's jurisdiction and irrevocably appoints the court clerk as its agent for receiving service of any papers that affect its liability on the security. The security provider's liability may be enforced on motion without an independent action. The motion and any notice that the court orders may be served on the court clerk, who must promptly send a copy of each to every security provider whose address is known.

### Rule 66. Receivers
* These rules govern an action in which the appointment of a receiver is sought or a receiver sues or is sued. But the practice in administering an estate by a receiver or a similar court-appointed officer must accord with the historical practice in federal courts or with a local rule. An action in which a receiver has been appointed may be dismissed only by court order.

### Rule 67. Deposit into Court
* (a) DEPOSITING PROPERTY. If any part of the relief sought is a money judgment or the disposition of a sum of money or some other deliverable thing, a party—on notice to every other party and by leave of court—may deposit with the court all or part of the money or thing, whether or not that party claims any of it. The depositing party must deliver to the clerk a copy of the order permitting deposit.

* (b) INVESTING AND WITHDRAWING FUNDS. Money paid into court under this rule must be deposited and withdrawn in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §§2041 and 2042 and any like statute. The money must be deposited in an interest-bearing account or invested in a court-approved, interest-bearing instrument.

### Rule 68. Offer of Judgment
* (a) MAKING AN OFFER; JUDGMENT ON AN ACCEPTED OFFER. At least 14 days before the date set for trial, a party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms, with the costs then accrued. If, within 14 days after being served, the opposing party serves written notice accepting the offer, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance, plus proof of service. The clerk must then enter judgment.

* (b) UNACCEPTED OFFER. An unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn, but it does not preclude a later offer. Evidence of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs.

* (c) OFFER AFTER LIABILITY IS DETERMINED. When one party's liability to another has been determined but the extent of liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the party held liable may make an offer of judgment. It must be served within a reasonable time—but at least 14 days—before the date set for a hearing to determine the extent of liability.

* (d) PAYING COSTS AFTER AN UNACCEPTED OFFER. If the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.

### Rule 69. Execution
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure._ A money judgment is enforced by a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise. The procedure on execution—and in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of judgment or execution—must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located, but a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.

  * (2) _Obtaining Discovery._ In aid of the judgment or execution, the judgment creditor or a successor in interest whose interest appears of record may obtain discovery from any person—including the judgment debtor—as provided in these rules or by the procedure of the state where the court is located.


* (b) AGAINST CERTAIN PUBLIC OFFICERS. When a judgment has been entered against a revenue officer in the circumstances stated in 28 U.S.C. §2006, or against an officer of Congress in the circumstances stated in 2 U.S.C. §118, the judgment must be satisfied as those statutes provide.

### Rule 70. Enforcing a Judgment for a Specific Act
* (a) PARTY'S FAILURE TO ACT; ORDERING ANOTHER TO ACT. If a judgment requires a party to convey land, to deliver a deed or other document, or to perform any other specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may order the act to be done—at the disobedient party's expense—by another person appointed by the court. When done, the act has the same effect as if done by the party.

* (b) VESTING TITLE. If the real or personal property is within the district, the court—instead of ordering a conveyance—may enter a judgment divesting any party's title and vesting it in others. That judgment has the effect of a legally executed conveyance.

* (c) OBTAINING A WRIT OF ATTACHMENT OR SEQUESTRATION. On application by a party entitled to performance of an act, the clerk must issue a writ of attachment or sequestration against the disobedient party's property to compel obedience.

* (d) OBTAINING A WRIT OF EXECUTION OR ASSISTANCE. On application by a party who obtains a judgment or order for possession, the clerk must issue a writ of execution or assistance.

* (e) HOLDING IN CONTEMPT. The court may also hold the disobedient party in contempt.

### Rule 71. Enforcing Relief For or Against a Nonparty
* When an order grants relief for a nonparty or may be enforced against a nonparty, the procedure for enforcing the order is the same as for a party.
