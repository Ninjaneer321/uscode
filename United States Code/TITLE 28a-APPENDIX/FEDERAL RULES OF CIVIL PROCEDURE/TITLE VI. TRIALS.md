### TITLE VI. TRIALS

### Rule 38. Right to a Jury Trial; Demand
* (a) RIGHT PRESERVED. The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution—or as provided by a federal statute—is preserved to the parties inviolate.

* (b) DEMAND. On any issue triable of right by a jury, a party may demand a jury trial by:

  * (1) serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served; and

  * (2) filing the demand in accordance with Rule 5(d).


* (c) SPECIFYING ISSUES. In its demand, a party may specify the issues that it wishes to have tried by a jury; otherwise, it is considered to have demanded a jury trial on all the issues so triable. If the party has demanded a jury trial on only some issues, any other party may—within 14 days after being served with the demand or within a shorter time ordered by the court—serve a demand for a jury trial on any other or all factual issues triable by jury.

* (d) WAIVER; WITHDRAWAL. A party waives a jury trial unless its demand is properly served and filed. A proper demand may be withdrawn only if the parties consent.

* (e) ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME CLAIMS. These rules do not create a right to a jury trial on issues in a claim that is an admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h).

### Rule 39. Trial by Jury or by the Court
* (a) WHEN A DEMAND IS MADE. When a jury trial has been demanded under Rule 38, the action must be designated on the docket as a jury action. The trial on all issues so demanded must be by jury unless:

  * (1) the parties or their attorneys file a stipulation to a nonjury trial or so stipulate on the record; or

  * (2) the court, on motion or on its own, finds that on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a jury trial.


* (b) WHEN NO DEMAND IS MADE. Issues on which a jury trial is not properly demanded are to be tried by the court. But the court may, on motion, order a jury trial on any issue for which a jury might have been demanded.

* (c) ADVISORY JURY; JURY TRIAL BY CONSENT. In an action not triable of right by a jury, the court, on motion or on its own:

  * (1) may try any issue with an advisory jury; or

  * (2) may, with the parties' consent, try any issue by a jury whose verdict has the same effect as if a jury trial had been a matter of right, unless the action is against the United States and a federal statute provides for a nonjury trial.

### Rule 40. Scheduling Cases for Trial
* Each court must provide by rule for scheduling trials. The court must give priority to actions entitled to priority by a federal statute.

### Rule 41. Dismissal of Actions
* (a) VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL.

  * (1) _By the Plaintiff._

    * (A) _Without a Court Order._ Subject to Rules 23(e), 23.1(c), 23.2, and 66 and any applicable federal statute, the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order by filing:

      * (i) a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment; or

      * (ii) a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.


    * (B) _Effect._ Unless the notice or stipulation states otherwise, the dismissal is without prejudice. But if the plaintiff previously dismissed any federal- or state-court action based on or including the same claim, a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits.


  * (2) _By Court Order; Effect._ Except as provided in Rule 41(a)(1), an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper. If a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim before being served with the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action may be dismissed over the defendant's objection only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication. Unless the order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph (2) is without prejudice.


* (b) INVOLUNTARY DISMISSAL; EFFECT. If the plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it. Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this subdivision (b) and any dismissal not under this rule—except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19—operates as an adjudication on the merits.

* (c) DISMISSING A COUNTERCLAIM, CROSSCLAIM, OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM. This rule applies to a dismissal of any counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim. A claimant's voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) must be made:

  * (1) before a responsive pleading is served; or

  * (2) if there is no responsive pleading, before evidence is introduced at a hearing or trial.


* (d) COSTS OF A PREVIOUSLY DISMISSED ACTION. If a plaintiff who previously dismissed an action in any court files an action based on or including the same claim against the same defendant, the court:

  * (1) may order the plaintiff to pay all or part of the costs of that previous action; and

  * (2) may stay the proceedings until the plaintiff has complied.

### Rule 42. Consolidation; Separate Trials
* (a) CONSOLIDATION. If actions before the court involve a common question of law or fact, the court may:

  * (1) join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions;

  * (2) consolidate the actions; or

  * (3) issue any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.


* (b) SEPARATE TRIALS. For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and economize, the court may order a separate trial of one or more separate issues, claims, crossclaims, counterclaims, or third-party claims. When ordering a separate trial, the court must preserve any federal right to a jury trial.

### Rule 43. Taking Testimony
* (a) IN OPEN COURT. At trial, the witnesses' testimony must be taken in open court unless a federal statute, the Federal Rules of Evidence, these rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court provide otherwise. For good cause in compelling circumstances and with appropriate safeguards, the court may permit testimony in open court by contemporaneous transmission from a different location.

* (b) AFFIRMATION INSTEAD OF AN OATH. When these rules require an oath, a solemn affirmation suffices.

* (c) EVIDENCE ON A MOTION. When a motion relies on facts outside the record, the court may hear the matter on affidavits or may hear it wholly or partly on oral testimony or on depositions.

* (d) INTERPRETER. The court may appoint an interpreter of its choosing; fix reasonable compensation to be paid from funds provided by law or by one or more parties; and tax the compensation as costs.

### Rule 44. Proving an Official Record
* (a) MEANS OF PROVING.

  * (1) _Domestic Record._ Each of the following evidences an official record—or an entry in it—that is otherwise admissible and is kept within the United States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States:

    * (A) an official publication of the record; or

    * (B) a copy attested by the officer with legal custody of the record—or by the officer's deputy—and accompanied by a certificate that the officer has custody. The certificate must be made under seal:

      * (i) by a judge of a court of record in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept; or

      * (ii) by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept.


  * (2) _Foreign Record._

    * (A) _In General._ Each of the following evidences a foreign official record—or an entry in it—that is otherwise admissible:

      * (i) an official publication of the record; or

      * (ii) the record—or a copy—that is attested by an authorized person and is accompanied either by a final certification of genuineness or by a certification under a treaty or convention to which the United States and the country where the record is located are parties.


    * (B) _Final Certification of Genuineness._ A final certification must certify the genuineness of the signature and official position of the attester or of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness relates to the attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness relating to the attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of a United States embassy or legation; by a consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States.

    * (C) _Other Means of Proof._ If all parties have had a reasonable opportunity to investigate a foreign record's authenticity and accuracy, the court may, for good cause, either:

      * (i) admit an attested copy without final certification; or

      * (ii) permit the record to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without a final certification.


* (b) LACK OF A RECORD. A written statement that a diligent search of designated records revealed no record or entry of a specified tenor is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry. For domestic records, the statement must be authenticated under Rule 44(a)(1). For foreign records, the statement must comply with (a)(2)(C)(ii).

* (c) OTHER PROOF. A party may prove an official record—or an entry or lack of an entry in it—by any other method authorized by law.

### Rule 44.1. Determining Foreign Law
* A party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign country's law must give notice by a pleading or other writing. In determining foreign law, the court may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The court's determination must be treated as a ruling on a question of law.

### Rule 45. Subpoena
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Form and Contents._

    * (A) _Requirements—In General._ Every subpoena must:

      * (i) state the court from which it issued;

      * (ii) state the title of the action and its civil-action number;

      * (iii) command each person to whom it is directed to do the following at a specified time and place: attend and testify; produce designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person's possession, custody, or control; or permit the inspection of premises; and

      * (iv) set out the text of Rule 45(d) and (e).


    * (B) _Command to Attend a Deposition—Notice of the Recording Method._ A subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition must state the method for recording the testimony.

    * (C) _Combining or Separating a Command to Produce or to Permit Inspection; Specifying the Form for Electronically Stored Information._ A command to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or to permit the inspection of premises may be included in a subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition, hearing, or trial, or may be set out in a separate subpoena. A subpoena may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.

    * (D) _Command to Produce; Included Obligations._ A command in a subpoena to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things requires the responding person to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the materials.


  * (2) _Issuing Court._ A subpoena must issue from the court where the action is pending.

  * (3) _Issued by Whom._ The clerk must issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party who requests it. That party must complete it before service. An attorney also may issue and sign a subpoena if the attorney is authorized to practice in the issuing court.

  * (4) _Notice to Other Parties Before Service._ If the subpoena commands the production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or the inspection of premises before trial, then before it is served on the person to whom it is directed, a notice and a copy of the subpoena must be served on each party.


* (b) SERVICE.

  * (1) _By Whom and How; Tendering Fees._ Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a subpoena. Serving a subpoena requires delivering a copy to the named person and, if the subpoena requires that person's attendance, tendering the fees for 1 day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. Fees and mileage need not be tendered when the subpoena issues on behalf of the United States or any of its officers or agencies.

  * (2) _Service in the United States._ A subpoena may be served at any place within the United States.

  * (3) _Service in a Foreign Country._ 28 U.S.C. §1783 governs issuing and serving a subpoena directed to a United States national or resident who is in a foreign country.

  * (4) _Proof of Service._ Proving service, when necessary, requires filing with the issuing court a statement showing the date and manner of service and the names of the persons served. The statement must be certified by the server.


* (c) PLACE OF COMPLIANCE.

  * (1) _For a Trial, Hearing, or Deposition._ A subpoena may command a person to attend a trial, hearing, or deposition only as follows:

    * (A) within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person; or

    * (B) within the state where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person, if the person

      * (i) is a party or a party's officer; or

      * (ii) is commanded to attend a trial and would not incur substantial expense.


  * (2) _For Other Discovery._ A subpoena may command:

    * (A) production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things at a place within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person; and

    * (B) inspection of premises at the premises to be inspected.


* (d) PROTECTING A PERSON SUBJECT TO A SUBPOENA; ENFORCEMENT.

  * (1) _Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions._ A party or attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena. The court for the district where compliance is required must enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction—which may include lost earnings and reasonable attorney's fees—on a party or attorney who fails to comply.

  * (2) _Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection._

    * (A) _Appearance Not Required._ A person commanded to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition, hearing, or trial.

    * (B) _Objections._ A person commanded to produce documents or tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the premises—or to producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the following rules apply:

      * (i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party may move the court for the district where compliance is required for an order compelling production or inspection.

      * (ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer from significant expense resulting from compliance.


  * (3) _Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena._

    * (A) _When Required._ On timely motion, the court for the district where compliance is required must quash or modify a subpoena that:

      * (i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply;

      * (ii) requires a person to comply beyond the geographical limits specified in Rule 45(c);

      * (iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or

      * (iv) subjects a person to undue burden.


    * (B) _When Permitted._ To protect a person subject to or affected by a subpoena, the court for the district where compliance is required may, on motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:

      * (i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information; or

      * (ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or information that does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert's study that was not requested by a party.


    * (C) _Specifying Conditions as an Alternative._ In the circumstances described in Rule 45(d)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under specified conditions if the serving party:

      * (i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and

      * (ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated.


* (e) DUTIES IN RESPONDING TO A SUBPOENA.

  * (1) _Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information._ These procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored information:

    * (A) _Documents._ A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the demand.

    * (B) _Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not Specified._ If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, the person responding must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms.

    * (C) _Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One Form._ The person responding need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.

    * (D) _Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information._ The person responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.


  * (2) _Claiming Privilege or Protection._

    * (A) _Information Withheld._ A person withholding subpoenaed information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must:

      * (i) expressly make the claim; and

      * (ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim.


    * (B) _Information Produced._ If information produced in response to a subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information under seal to the court for the district where compliance is required for a determination of the claim. The person who produced the information must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.


* (f) TRANSFERRING A SUBPOENA-RELATED MOTION. When the court where compliance is required did not issue the subpoena, it may transfer a motion under this rule to the issuing court if the person subject to the subpoena consents or if the court finds exceptional circumstances. Then, if the attorney for a person subject to a subpoena is authorized to practice in the court where the motion was made, the attorney may file papers and appear on the motion as an officer of the issuing court. To enforce its order, the issuing court may transfer the order to the court where the motion was made.

* (g) CONTEMPT. The court for the district where compliance is required—and also, after a motion is transferred, the issuing court—may hold in contempt a person who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the subpoena or an order related to it.

### Rule 46. Objecting to a Ruling or Order
* A formal exception to a ruling or order is unnecessary. When the ruling or order is requested or made, a party need only state the action that it wants the court to take or objects to, along with the grounds for the request or objection. Failing to object does not prejudice a party who had no opportunity to do so when the ruling or order was made.

### Rule 47. Selecting Jurors
* (a) EXAMINING JURORS. The court may permit the parties or their attorneys to examine prospective jurors or may itself do so. If the court examines the jurors, it must permit the parties or their attorneys to make any further inquiry it considers proper, or must itself ask any of their additional questions it considers proper.

* (b) PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. The court must allow the number of peremptory challenges provided by 28 U.S.C. §1870.

* (c) EXCUSING A JUROR. During trial or deliberation, the court may excuse a juror for good cause.

### Rule 48. Number of Jurors; Verdict; Polling
* (a) NUMBER OF JURORS. A jury must begin with at least 6 and no more than 12 members, and each juror must participate in the verdict unless excused under Rule 47(c).

* (b) VERDICT. Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the verdict must be unanimous and must be returned by a jury of at least 6 members.

* (c) POLLING. After a verdict is returned but before the jury is discharged, the court must on a party's request, or may on its own, poll the jurors individually. If the poll reveals a lack of unanimity or lack of assent by the number of jurors that the parties stipulated to, the court may direct the jury to deliberate further or may order a new trial.

### Rule 49. Special Verdict; General Verdict and Questions
* (a) SPECIAL VERDICT.

  * (1) _In General._ The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding on each issue of fact. The court may do so by:

    * (A) submitting written questions susceptible of a categorical or other brief answer;

    * (B) submitting written forms of the special findings that might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or

    * (C) using any other method that the court considers appropriate.


  * (2) _Instructions._ The court must give the instructions and explanations necessary to enable the jury to make its findings on each submitted issue.

  * (3) _Issues Not Submitted._ A party waives the right to a jury trial on any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or evidence but not submitted to the jury unless, before the jury retires, the party demands its submission to the jury. If the party does not demand submission, the court may make a finding on the issue. If the court makes no finding, it is considered to have made a finding consistent with its judgment on the special verdict.


* (b) GENERAL VERDICT WITH ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS.

  * (1) _In General._ The court may submit to the jury forms for a general verdict, together with written questions on one or more issues of fact that the jury must decide. The court must give the instructions and explanations necessary to enable the jury to render a general verdict and answer the questions in writing, and must direct the jury to do both.

  * (2) _Verdict and Answers Consistent._ When the general verdict and the answers are consistent, the court must approve, for entry under Rule 58, an appropriate judgment on the verdict and answers.

  * (3) _Answers Inconsistent with the Verdict._ When the answers are consistent with each other but one or more is inconsistent with the general verdict, the court may:

    * (A) approve, for entry under Rule 58, an appropriate judgment according to the answers, notwithstanding the general verdict;

    * (B) direct the jury to further consider its answers and verdict; or

    * (C) order a new trial.


  * (4) _Answers Inconsistent with Each Other and the Verdict._ When the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is also inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment must not be entered; instead, the court must direct the jury to further consider its answers and verdict, or must order a new trial.

### Rule 50. Judgment as a Matter of Law in a Jury Trial; Related Motion for a New Trial; Conditional Ruling
* (a) JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW.

  * (1) _In General._ If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may:

    * (A) resolve the issue against the party; and

    * (B) grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.


  * (2) _Motion._ A motion for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before the case is submitted to the jury. The motion must specify the judgment sought and the law and facts that entitle the movant to the judgment.


* (b) RENEWING THE MOTION AFTER TRIAL; ALTERNATIVE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL. If the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made under Rule 50(a), the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment—or if the motion addresses a jury issue not decided by a verdict, no later than 28 days after the jury was discharged—the movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on the renewed motion, the court may:

  * (1) allow judgment on the verdict, if the jury returned a verdict;

  * (2) order a new trial; or

  * (3) direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law.


* (c) GRANTING THE RENEWED MOTION; CONDITIONAL RULING ON A MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL.

  * (1) _In General._ If the court grants a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, it must also conditionally rule on any motion for a new trial by determining whether a new trial should be granted if the judgment is later vacated or reversed. The court must state the grounds for conditionally granting or denying the motion for a new trial.

  * (2) _Effect of a Conditional Ruling._ Conditionally granting the motion for a new trial does not affect the judgment's finality; if the judgment is reversed, the new trial must proceed unless the appellate court orders otherwise. If the motion for a new trial is conditionally denied, the appellee may assert error in that denial; if the judgment is reversed, the case must proceed as the appellate court orders.


* (d) TIME FOR A LOSING PARTY'S NEW-TRIAL MOTION. Any motion for a new trial under Rule 59 by a party against whom judgment as a matter of law is rendered must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.

* (e) DENYING THE MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW; REVERSAL ON APPEAL. If the court denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the prevailing party may, as appellee, assert grounds entitling it to a new trial should the appellate court conclude that the trial court erred in denying the motion. If the appellate court reverses the judgment, it may order a new trial, direct the trial court to determine whether a new trial should be granted, or direct the entry of judgment.

### Rule 51. Instructions to the Jury; Objections; Preserving a Claim of Error
* (a) REQUESTS.

  * (1) _Before or at the Close of the Evidence._ At the close of the evidence or at any earlier reasonable time that the court orders, a party may file and furnish to every other party written requests for the jury instructions it wants the court to give.

  * (2) _After the Close of the Evidence._ After the close of the evidence, a party may:

    * (A) file requests for instructions on issues that could not reasonably have been anticipated by an earlier time that the court set for requests; and

    * (B) with the court's permission, file untimely requests for instructions on any issue.


* (b) INSTRUCTIONS. The court:

  * (1) must inform the parties of its proposed instructions and proposed action on the requests before instructing the jury and before final jury arguments;

  * (2) must give the parties an opportunity to object on the record and out of the jury's hearing before the instructions and arguments are delivered; and

  * (3) may instruct the jury at any time before the jury is discharged.


* (c) OBJECTIONS.

  * (1) _How to Make._ A party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.

  * (2) _When to Make._ An objection is timely if:

    * (A) a party objects at the opportunity provided under Rule 51(b)(2); or

    * (B) a party was not informed of an instruction or action on a request before that opportunity to object, and the party objects promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused.


* (d) ASSIGNING ERROR; PLAIN ERROR.

  * (1) _Assigning Error._ A party may assign as error:

    * (A) an error in an instruction actually given, if that party properly objected; or

    * (B) a failure to give an instruction, if that party properly requested it and—unless the court rejected the request in a definitive ruling on the record—also properly objected.


  * (2) _Plain Error._ A court may consider a plain error in the instructions that has not been preserved as required by Rule 51(d)(1) if the error affects substantial rights.

### Rule 52. Findings and Conclusions by the Court; Judgment on Partial Findings
* (a) FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS.

  * (1) _In General._ In an action tried on the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately. The findings and conclusions may be stated on the record after the close of the evidence or may appear in an opinion or a memorandum of decision filed by the court. Judgment must be entered under Rule 58.

  * (2) _For an Interlocutory Injunction._ In granting or refusing an interlocutory injunction, the court must similarly state the findings and conclusions that support its action.

  * (3) _For a Motion._ The court is not required to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a motion under Rule 12 or 56 or, unless these rules provide otherwise, on any other motion.

  * (4) _Effect of a Master's Findings._ A master's findings, to the extent adopted by the court, must be considered the court's findings.

  * (5) _Questioning the Evidentiary Support._ A party may later question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings, whether or not the party requested findings, objected to them, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.

  * (6) _Setting Aside the Findings._ Findings of fact, whether based on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the witnesses' credibility.


* (b) AMENDED OR ADDITIONAL FINDINGS. On a party's motion filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the court may amend its findings—or make additional findings—and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.

* (c) JUDGMENT ON PARTIAL FINDINGS. If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a nonjury trial and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue. The court may, however, decline to render any judgment until the close of the evidence. A judgment on partial findings must be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Rule 52(a).

### Rule 53. Masters
* (a) APPOINTMENT.

  * (1) _Scope._ Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court may appoint a master only to:

    * (A) perform duties consented to by the parties;

    * (B) hold trial proceedings and make or recommend findings of fact on issues to be decided without a jury if appointment is warranted by:

      * (i) some exceptional condition; or

      * (ii) the need to perform an accounting or resolve a difficult computation of damages; or
