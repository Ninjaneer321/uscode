### TITLE IV. PARTIES

### Rule 17. Plaintiff and Defendant; Capacity; Public Officers
* (a) REAL PARTY IN INTEREST.

  * (1) _Designation in General._ An action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. The following may sue in their own names without joining the person for whose benefit the action is brought:

    * (A) an executor;

    * (B) an administrator;

    * (C) a guardian;

    * (D) a bailee;

    * (E) a trustee of an express trust;

    * (F) a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for another's benefit; and

    * (G) a party authorized by statute.


  * (2) _Action in the Name of the United States for Another's Use or Benefit._ When a federal statute so provides, an action for another's use or benefit must be brought in the name of the United States.

  * (3) _Joinder of the Real Party in Interest._ The court may not dismiss an action for failure to prosecute in the name of the real party in interest until, after an objection, a reasonable time has been allowed for the real party in interest to ratify, join, or be substituted into the action. After ratification, joinder, or substitution, the action proceeds as if it had been originally commenced by the real party in interest.


* (b) CAPACITY TO SUE OR BE SUED. Capacity to sue or be sued is determined as follows:

  * (1) for an individual who is not acting in a representative capacity, by the law of the individual's domicile;

  * (2) for a corporation, by the law under which it was organized; and

  * (3) for all other parties, by the law of the state where the court is located, except that:

    * (A) a partnership or other unincorporated association with no such capacity under that state's law may sue or be sued in its common name to enforce a substantive right existing under the United States Constitution or laws; and

    * (B) 28 U.S.C. §§754 and 959(a) govern the capacity of a receiver appointed by a United States court to sue or be sued in a United States court.


* (c) MINOR OR INCOMPETENT PERSON.

  * (1) _With a Representative._ The following representatives may sue or defend on behalf of a minor or an incompetent person:

    * (A) a general guardian;

    * (B) a committee;

    * (C) a conservator; or

    * (D) a like fiduciary.


  * (2) _Without a Representative._ A minor or an incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court must appoint a guardian ad litem—or issue another appropriate order—to protect a minor or incompetent person who is unrepresented in an action.


* (d) PUBLIC OFFICER'S TITLE AND NAME. A public officer who sues or is sued in an official capacity may be designated by official title rather than by name, but the court may order that the officer's name be added.

### Rule 18. Joinder of Claims
* (a) IN GENERAL. A party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, as independent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing party.

* (b) JOINDER OF CONTINGENT CLAIMS. A party may join two claims even though one of them is contingent on the disposition of the other; but the court may grant relief only in accordance with the parties' relative substantive rights. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to set aside a conveyance that is fraudulent as to that plaintiff, without first obtaining a judgment for the money.

### Rule 19. Required Joinder of Parties
* (a) PERSONS REQUIRED TO BE JOINED IF FEASIBLE.

  * (1) _Required Party._ A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:

    * (A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or

    * (B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may:

      * (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or

      * (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.


  * (2) _Joinder by Court Order._ If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.

  * (3) _Venue._ If a joined party objects to venue and the joinder would make venue improper, the court must dismiss that party.


* (b) WHEN JOINDER IS NOT FEASIBLE. If a person who is required to be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include:

  * (1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;

  * (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by:

    * (A) protective provisions in the judgment;

    * (B) shaping the relief; or

    * (C) other measures;


  * (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and

  * (4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.


* (c) PLEADING THE REASONS FOR NONJOINDER. When asserting a claim for relief, a party must state:

  * (1) the name, if known, of any person who is required to be joined if feasible but is not joined; and

  * (2) the reasons for not joining that person.


* (d) EXCEPTION FOR CLASS ACTIONS. This rule is subject to Rule 23.

### Rule 20. Permissive Joinder of Parties
* (a) PERSONS WHO MAY JOIN OR BE JOINED.

  * (1) _Plaintiffs._ Persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if:

    * (A) they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and

    * (B) any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action.


  * (2) _Defendants._ Persons—as well as a vessel, cargo, or other property subject to admiralty process in rem—may be joined in one action as defendants if:

    * (A) any right to relief is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and

    * (B) any question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action.


  * (3) _Extent of Relief._ Neither a plaintiff nor a defendant need be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. The court may grant judgment to one or more plaintiffs according to their rights, and against one or more defendants according to their liabilities.


* (b) PROTECTIVE MEASURES. The court may issue orders—including an order for separate trials—to protect a party against embarrassment, delay, expense, or other prejudice that arises from including a person against whom the party asserts no claim and who asserts no claim against the party.

### Rule 21. Misjoinder and Nonjoinder of Parties
* Misjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissing an action. On motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party. The court may also sever any claim against a party.

### Rule 22. Interpleader
* (a) GROUNDS.

  * (1) _By a Plaintiff._ Persons with claims that may expose a plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined as defendants and required to interplead. Joinder for interpleader is proper even though:

    * (A) the claims of the several claimants, or the titles on which their claims depend, lack a common origin or are adverse and independent rather than identical; or

    * (B) the plaintiff denies liability in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants.


  * (2) _By a Defendant._ A defendant exposed to similar liability may seek interpleader through a crossclaim or counterclaim.


* (b) RELATION TO OTHER RULES AND STATUTES. This rule supplements—and does not limit—the joinder of parties allowed by Rule 20. The remedy this rule provides is in addition to—and does not supersede or limit—the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. §§1335, 1397, and 2361. An action under those statutes must be conducted under these rules.

### Rule 23. Class Actions
* (a) PREREQUISITES. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if:

  * (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;

  * (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;

  * (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and

  * (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.


* (b) TYPES OF CLASS ACTIONS. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if:

  * (1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of:

    * (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or

    * (B) adjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests;


  * (2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole; or

  * (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include:

    * (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;

    * (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;

    * (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and

    * (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.


* (c) CERTIFICATION ORDER; NOTICE TO CLASS MEMBERS; JUDGMENT; ISSUES CLASSES; SUBCLASSES.

  * (1) _Certification Order._

    * (A) _Time to Issue._ At an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.

    * (B) _Defining the Class; Appointing Class Counsel._ An order that certifies a class action must define the class and the class claims, issues, or defenses, and must appoint class counsel under Rule 23(g).

    * (C) _Altering or Amending the Order._ An order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.


  * (2) _Notice._

    * (A) _For (b)(1) or (b)(2) Classes._ For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), the court may direct appropriate notice to the class.

    * (B) _For (b)(3) Classes._ For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3)—or upon ordering notice under Rule 23(e)(1) to a class proposed to be certified for purposes of settlement under Rule 23(b)(3)—the court must direct to class members the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice may be by one or more of the following: United States mail, electronic means, or other appropriate means. The notice must clearly and concisely state in plain, easily understood language:

      * (i) the nature of the action;

      * (ii) the definition of the class certified;

      * (iii) the class claims, issues, or defenses;

      * (iv) that a class member may enter an appearance through an attorney if the member so desires;

      * (v) that the court will exclude from the class any member who requests exclusion;

      * (vi) the time and manner for requesting exclusion; and

      * (vii) the binding effect of a class judgment on members under Rule 23(c)(3).


  * (3) _Judgment._ Whether or not favorable to the class, the judgment in a class action must:

    * (A) for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), include and describe those whom the court finds to be class members; and

    * (B) for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), include and specify or describe those to whom the Rule 23(c)(2) notice was directed, who have not requested exclusion, and whom the court finds to be class members.


  * (4) _Particular Issues._ When appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.

  * (5) _Subclasses._ When appropriate, a class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.


* (d) CONDUCTING THE ACTION.

  * (1) _In General._ In conducting an action under this rule, the court may issue orders that:

    * (A) determine the course of proceedings or prescribe measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in presenting evidence or argument;

    * (B) require—to protect class members and fairly conduct the action—giving appropriate notice to some or all class members of:

      * (i) any step in the action;

      * (ii) the proposed extent of the judgment; or

      * (iii) the members' opportunity to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or to otherwise come into the action;


    * (C) impose conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors;

    * (D) require that the pleadings be amended to eliminate allegations about representation of absent persons and that the action proceed accordingly; or

    * (E) deal with similar procedural matters.


  * (2) _Combining and Amending Orders._ An order under Rule 23(d)(1) may be altered or amended from time to time and may be combined with an order under Rule 16.


* (e) SETTLEMENT, VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL, OR COMPROMISE. The claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class—or a class proposed to be certified for purposes of settlement—may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court's approval. The following procedures apply to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise:

  * (1) _Notice to the Class._

    * (A) _Information That Parties Must Provide to the Court._ The parties must provide the court with information sufficient to enable it to determine whether to give notice of the proposal to the class.

    * (B) _Grounds for a Decision to Give Notice._ The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal if giving notice is justified by the parties' showing that the court will likely be able to:

      * (i) approve the proposal under Rule 23(e)(2); and

      * (ii) certify the class for purposes of judgment on the proposal.


  * (2) _Approval of the Proposal._ If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and only on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering whether:

    * (A) the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class;

    * (B) the proposal was negotiated at arm's length;

    * (C) the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account:

      * (i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal;

      * (ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the class, including the method of processing class-member claims;

      * (iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, including timing of payment; and

      * (iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and


    * (D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other.


  * (3) _Identifying Agreements._ The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with the proposal.

  * (4) _New Opportunity to Be Excluded._ If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so.

  * (5) _Class-Member Objections._

    * (A) _In General._ Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e). The objection must state whether it applies only to the objector, to a specific subset of the class, or to the entire class, and also state with specificity the grounds for the objection.

    * (B) _Court Approval Required for Payment in Connection with an Objection._ Unless approved by the court after a hearing, no payment or other consideration may be provided in connection with:

      * (i) forgoing or withdrawing an objection, or

      * (ii) forgoing, dismissing, or abandoning an appeal from a judgment approving the proposal.


    * (C) _Procedure for Approval After an Appeal._ If approval under Rule 23(e)(5)(B) has not been obtained before an appeal is docketed in the court of appeals, the procedure of Rule 62.1 applies while the appeal remains pending.


* (f) APPEALS. A court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying class-action certification under this rule, but not from an order under Rule 23(e)(1). A party must file a petition for permission to appeal with the circuit clerk within 14 days after the order is entered, or within 45 days after the order is entered if any party is the United States, a United States agency, or a United States officer or employee sued for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States' behalf. An appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.

* (g) CLASS COUNSEL.

  * (1) _Appointing Class Counsel._ Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court that certifies a class must appoint class counsel. In appointing class counsel, the court:

    * (A) must consider:

      * (i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action;

      * (ii) counsel's experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action;

      * (iii) counsel's knowledge of the applicable law; and

      * (iv) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class;


    * (B) may consider any other matter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class;

    * (C) may order potential class counsel to provide information on any subject pertinent to the appointment and to propose terms for attorney's fees and nontaxable costs;

    * (D) may include in the appointing order provisions about the award of attorney's fees or nontaxable costs under Rule 23(h); and

    * (E) may make further orders in connection with the appointment.


  * (2) _Standard for Appointing Class Counsel._ When one applicant seeks appointment as class counsel, the court may appoint that applicant only if the applicant is adequate under Rule 23(g)(1) and (4). If more than one adequate applicant seeks appointment, the court must appoint the applicant best able to represent the interests of the class.

  * (3) _Interim Counsel._ The court may designate interim counsel to act on behalf of a putative class before determining whether to certify the action as a class action.

  * (4) _Duty of Class Counsel._ Class counsel must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.


* (h) ATTORNEY'S FEES AND NONTAXABLE COSTS. In a certified class action, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees and nontaxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties' agreement. The following procedures apply:

  * (1) A claim for an award must be made by motion under Rule 54(d)(2), subject to the provisions of this subdivision (h), at a time the court sets. Notice of the motion must be served on all parties and, for motions by class counsel, directed to class members in a reasonable manner.

  * (2) A class member, or a party from whom payment is sought, may object to the motion.

  * (3) The court may hold a hearing and must find the facts and state its legal conclusions under Rule 52(a).

  * (4) The court may refer issues related to the amount of the award to a special master or a magistrate judge, as provided in Rule 54(d)(2)(D).

### Rule 23.1. Derivative Actions
* (a) PREREQUISITES. This rule applies when one or more shareholders or members of a corporation or an unincorporated association bring a derivative action to enforce a right that the corporation or association may properly assert but has failed to enforce. The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of shareholders or members who are similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association.

* (b) PLEADING REQUIREMENTS. The complaint must be verified and must:

  * (1) allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction complained of, or that the plaintiff's share or membership later devolved on it by operation of law;

  * (2) allege that the action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction that the court would otherwise lack; and

  * (3) state with particularity:

    * (A) any effort by the plaintiff to obtain the desired action from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members; and

    * (B) the reasons for not obtaining the action or not making the effort.


* (c) SETTLEMENT, DISMISSAL, AND COMPROMISE. A derivative action may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court's approval. Notice of a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise must be given to shareholders or members in the manner that the court orders.

### Rule 23.2. Actions Relating to Unincorporated Associations
* This rule applies to an action brought by or against the members of an unincorporated association as a class by naming certain members as representative parties. The action may be maintained only if it appears that those parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the association and its members. In conducting the action, the court may issue any appropriate orders corresponding with those in Rule 23(d), and the procedure for settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise must correspond with the procedure in Rule 23(e).

### Rule 24. Intervention
* (a) INTERVENTION OF RIGHT. On timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who:

  * (1) is given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or

  * (2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.


* (b) PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION.

  * (1) _In General._ On timely motion, the court may permit anyone to intervene who:

    * (A) is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or

    * (B) has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.


  * (2) _By a Government Officer or Agency._ On timely motion, the court may permit a federal or state governmental officer or agency to intervene if a party's claim or defense is based on:

    * (A) a statute or executive order administered by the officer or agency; or

    * (B) any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued or made under the statute or executive order.


  * (3) _Delay or Prejudice._ In exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.


* (c) NOTICE AND PLEADING REQUIRED. A motion to intervene must be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5. The motion must state the grounds for intervention and be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.

### Rule 25. Substitution of Parties
* (a) DEATH.

  * (1) _Substitution if the Claim Is Not Extinguished._ If a party dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper party. A motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the decedent's successor or representative. If the motion is not made within 90 days after service of a statement noting the death, the action by or against the decedent must be dismissed.

  * (2) _Continuation Among the Remaining Parties._ After a party's death, if the right sought to be enforced survives only to or against the remaining parties, the action does not abate, but proceeds in favor of or against the remaining parties. The death should be noted on the record.

  * (3) _Service._ A motion to substitute, together with a notice of hearing, must be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and on nonparties as provided in Rule 4. A statement noting death must be served in the same manner. Service may be made in any judicial district.


* (b) INCOMPETENCY. If a party becomes incompetent, the court may, on motion, permit the action to be continued by or against the party's representative. The motion must be served as provided in Rule 25(a)(3).

* (c) TRANSFER OF INTEREST. If an interest is transferred, the action may be continued by or against the original party unless the court, on motion, orders the transferee to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. The motion must be served as provided in Rule 25(a)(3).

* (d) PUBLIC OFFICERS; DEATH OR SEPARATION FROM OFFICE. An action does not abate when a public officer who is a party in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office while the action is pending. The officer's successor is automatically substituted as a party. Later proceedings should be in the substituted party's name, but any misnomer not affecting the parties' substantial rights must be disregarded. The court may order substitution at any time, but the absence of such an order does not affect the substitution.
