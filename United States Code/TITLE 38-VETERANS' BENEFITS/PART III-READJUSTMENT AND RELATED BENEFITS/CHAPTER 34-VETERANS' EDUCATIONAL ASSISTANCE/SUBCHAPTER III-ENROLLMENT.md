### SUBCHAPTER III—ENROLLMENT

### §3470. Selection of program
* Subject to the provisions of this chapter, each eligible veteran may select a program of education to assist the veteran in attaining an educational, professional, or vocational objective at any educational institution (approved in accordance with chapter 36 of this title) selected by the veteran, which will accept and retain the veteran as a student or trainee in any field or branch of knowledge which such institution finds the veteran qualified to undertake or pursue.

### §3471. Applications; approval
* Any eligible veteran, or any person on active duty (after consultation with the appropriate service education officer), who desires to initiate a program of education under this chapter shall submit an application to the Secretary which shall be in such form, and contain such information, as the Secretary shall prescribe. The Secretary shall approve such application unless the Secretary finds that (1) such veteran or person is not eligible for or entitled to the educational assistance for which application is made, (2) the veteran's or person's selected educational institution or training establishment fails to meet any requirement of this chapter or chapter 36 of this title, (3) the veteran's or person's enrollment in, or pursuit of, the program of education selected would violate any provision of this chapter or chapter 36 of this title, or (4) the veteran or person is already qualified, by reason of previous education or training, for the educational, professional, or vocational objective for which the program of education is offered. The Secretary shall not treat a person as already qualified for the objective of a program of education offered by a qualified provider of entrepreneurship courses solely because such person is the owner or operator of a business. The Secretary shall notify the veteran or person of the approval or disapproval of the veteran's or person's application.

### §3474. Discontinuance for unsatisfactory conduct or progress
* The Secretary shall discontinue the educational assistance allowance of an eligible veteran if, at any time, the Secretary finds that according to the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the educational institution, the veteran's attendance, conduct, or progress is unsatisfactory. The Secretary may renew the payment of the educational assistance allowance only if the Secretary finds that—

  * (1) the veteran will be resuming enrollment at the same educational institution in the same program of education and the educational institution has both approved such veteran's reenrollment and certified it to the Department of Veterans Affairs; or

  * (2) in the case of a proposed change of either educational institution or program of education by the veteran—

    * (A) the cause of the unsatisfactory attendance, conduct, or progress has been removed;

    * (B) the program proposed to be pursued is suitable to the veteran's aptitudes, interests, and abilities; and

    * (C) if a proposed change of program is involved, the change meets the requirements for approval under section 3691 of this title.

### §3476. Education outside the United States
* An eligible veteran may not enroll in any course offered by an educational institution not located in a State unless that educational institution is an approved institution of higher learning and the course is approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may deny or discontinue educational assistance under this chapter in the case of any veteran enrolled in an institution of higher learning not located in a State if the Secretary determines that such enrollment is not in the best interest of the veteran or the Federal Government.
