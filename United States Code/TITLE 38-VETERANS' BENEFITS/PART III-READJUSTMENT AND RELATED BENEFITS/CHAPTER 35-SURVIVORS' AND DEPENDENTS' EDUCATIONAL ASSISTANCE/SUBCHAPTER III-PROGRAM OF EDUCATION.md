### §3521. Approval of application
* The Secretary shall approve an application if the Secretary finds that—

  * (1) the proposed program of education constitutes a "program of education" as that term is defined in this chapter;

  * (2) the eligible person is not already qualified, by reason of previous education or training, for the educational, professional, or vocational objective for which the program of education is offered;

### §3523. Disapproval of enrollment in certain courses
* (a) The Secretary shall not approve the enrollment of an eligible person in—

  * (1) any bartending course or personality development course;

  * (2) any sales or sales management course which does not provide specialized training within a specific vocational field;

  * (3) any type of course which the Secretary finds to be avocational or recreational in character (or the advertising for which the Secretary finds contains significant avocational or recreational themes) unless the eligible person submits justification showing that the course will be a bona fide use in the pursuit of the person's present or contemplated business or occupation; or

  * (4) any independent study program except an accredited independent study program (including open circuit television) leading to a standard college degree.


* (b) The Secretary shall not approve the enrollment of an eligible person in any course of flight training other than one given by an educational institution of higher learning for credit toward a standard college degree the eligible person is seeking.
