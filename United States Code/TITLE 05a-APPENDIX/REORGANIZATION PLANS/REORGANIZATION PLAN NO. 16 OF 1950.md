#### Eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3176, 64 Stat. 1268
* Prepared by the President and transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives in Congress assembled, March 13, 1950, pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, approved June 20, 1949 [see 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.].

#### CERTAIN EDUCATION AND HEALTH FUNCTIONS
#### Section 1. Transfer of Functions
* There are hereby transferred to the Federal Security Administrator all functions of the Administrator of General Services under the Act of September 10, 1949, entitled "An Act to provide assistance for local school agencies in providing educational opportunities for children on Federal reservations or in defense areas, and for other purposes [former 20 U.S.C. 231â€“235]," and under the Water Pollution Control Act, approved June 30, 1948, as amended [33 U.S.C. 1151 et seq., see 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.], together with so much of any other function of the Administrator of General Services or of the General Services Administration as is incidental to or necessary for the carrying out of the provisions of such Acts.

#### Sec. 2. Performance of Transferred Functions
* The Federal Security Administrator may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, or by any agency or employee, of the Federal Security Agency of any function transferred to such Administrator by the provisions of this reorganization plan.

#### Sec. 3. Transfer of Records, Property, Personnel, and Funds
* There are hereby transferred to the Federal Security Agency, to be used, employed, and expended in connection with the functions transferred by the provisions of this reorganization plan, the records and property now being used or held in connection with such functions, the personnel employed in connection with such functions, and the unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds available or to be made available for use in connection with such functions. Such further measures and dispositions as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall determine to be necessary in order to effectuate the transfers provided for in this section shall be carried out in such manner as the Director shall direct and by such agencies as he shall designate.

* [Federal Security Agency abolished and functions transferred to Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (Health and Human Services) by Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1953.]

#### Message of the President
* To the Congress of the United States:

* I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 16 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Federal Security Agency the functions of the General Services Administration relating to assistance to local school districts and grants and loans for water-pollution-control projects. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.

* After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 16 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.

* The transfer of the responsibility for making payments to local school districts whose operating deficits are due in part to Federal activities is unlikely to result in an immediate reduction in expenditures for the administration of the program. However, by placing the function in the agency of the Government best informed in matters of public-school administration and presently charged with the payment of other grants for educational purposes, the plan will provide additional assurance that the funds appropriated for assistance to overburdened school districts will be most advantageously expended.

* The relative newness and expanding character of the water-pollution-control program prevents the itemization of the reductions in expenditures which will follow the consolidation of responsibility for this activity. It is expected that the elimination of overlapping and the simplification of relationships which will result from the transfer will make it possible to administer grants and loans more expeditiously and at lower costs per project than can be done under the present division of responsibility.
