## **REORGANIZATION PLAN NO. 15 OF 1950**
#### Eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3176, 64 Stat. 1267
* Prepared by the President and transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives in Congress assembled, March 13, 1950, pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, approved June 20, 1949 [see 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.].

#### ALASKA AND VIRGIN ISLANDS PUBLIC WORKS
#### Section 1. Transfer of Functions
* There are hereby transferred to the Secretary of the Interior all functions of the Administrator of General Services under the Alaska Public Works Act, approved August 24, 1949, and under the Act of December 20, 1944, 58 Stat. 827, entitled "An Act to assist in the internal development of the Virgin Islands by the undertaking of useful projects therein, and for other purposes," as amended [48 U.S.C. 1409 et seq.], together with so much of any other function of the Administrator of General Services or of the General Services Administration as is incidental to or necessary for the carrying out of the provisions of such Acts.

#### Sec. 2. Performance of Transferred Functions
* The Secretary of the Interior may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, or by any agency or employee, of the Department of the Interior of any function transferred to such Secretary by the provisions of this reorganization plan.

#### Sec. 3. Transfer of Records, Property, Personnel, and Funds
* There are hereby transferred to the Department of the Interior, to be used, employed, and expended in connection with the functions transferred by the provisions of this reorganization plan, the records and property now being used or held in connection with such functions, the personnel employed in connection with such functions, and the unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds available or to be made available for use in connection with such functions. Such further measures and dispositions as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall determine to be necessary in order to effectuate the transfers provided for in this section shall be carried out in such manner as the Director shall direct and by such agencies as he shall designate.

#### Message of the President
* To the Congress of the United States:

* I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 15 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers the functions of the General Services Administration relating to public works in Alaska and in the Virgin Islands to the Department of the Interior. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.

* After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 15 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.

* The savings to be realized from the transfers provided for in the plan cannot be predicted in detail at this time. The small size and restricted character of the Virgin Islands public-works program will prevent large reductions in administrative expenditures. However, by placing the responsibility for the activity in the Department generally concerned with the government and welfare of the islands, the plan will lead to a closer integration of the public-works program with verified needs.

* The Alaska public-works program is new and will continue to grow for some time. As a result the over-all costs of administration will increase under any organizational arrangements which may be established. The concentration of responsibility in the Department already charged with the execution of related programs in Alaska and required by law to approve all projects constructed under the Alaska Public Works Act of 1949 should, however, simplify relationships and lead to more economical administration than would otherwise be possible.
