# FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT

### §1. Short title
* This Act may be cited as the "Federal Advisory Committee Act".

### §2. Findings and purpose
* (a) The Congress finds that there are numerous committees, boards, commissions, councils, and similar groups which have been established to advise officers and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government and that they are frequently a useful and beneficial means of furnishing expert advice, ideas, and diverse opinions to the Federal Government.

* (b) The Congress further finds and declares that—

  * (1) the need for many existing advisory committees has not been adequately reviewed:

  * (2) new advisory committees should be established only when they are determined to be essential and their number should be kept to the minimum necessary;

  * (3) advisory committees should be terminated when they are no longer carrying out the purposes for which they were established;

  * (4) standards and uniform procedures should govern the establishment, operation, administration, and duration of advisory committees;

  * (5) the Congress and the public should be kept informed with respect to the number, purpose, membership, activities, and cost of advisory committees; and

  * (6) the function of advisory committees should be advisory only, and that all matters under their consideration should be determined, in accordance with law, by the official, agency, or officer involved.

### §3. Definitions
* For the purpose of this Act—

  * (1) The term "Administrator" means the Administrator of General Services.

  * (2) The term "advisory committee" means any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as "committee"), which is—

    * (A) established by statute or reorganization plan, or

    * (B) established or utilized by the President, or

    * (C) established or utilized by one or more agencies,


* in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government, except that such term excludes (i) any committee that is composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Government, and (ii) any committee that is created by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration.

  * (3) The term "agency" has the same meaning as in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code.

  * (4) The term "Presidential advisory committee" means an advisory committee which advises the President.

### §4. Applicability; restrictions
* (a) The provisions of this Act or of any rule, order, or regulation promulgated under this Act shall apply to each advisory committee except to the extent that any Act of Congress establishing any such advisory committee specifically provides otherwise.

* (b) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to apply to any advisory committee established or utilized by—

  * (1) the Central Intelligence Agency;

  * (2) the Federal Reserve System; or

  * (3) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, if the Director of National Intelligence determines that for reasons of national security such advisory committee cannot comply with the requirements of this Act.

### §5. Responsibilities of Congressional committees; review; guidelines
* (a) In the exercise of its legislative review function, each standing committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives shall make a continuing review of the activities of each advisory committee under its jurisdiction to determine whether such advisory committee should be abolished or merged with any other advisory committee, whether the responsibilities of such advisory committee should be revised, and whether such advisory committee performs a necessary function not already being performed. Each such standing committee shall take appropriate action to obtain the enactment of legislation necessary to carry out the purpose of this subsection.

* (b) In considering legislation establishing, or authorizing the establishment of any advisory committee, each standing committee of the Senate and of the House of Representatives shall determine, and report such determination to the Senate or to the House of Representatives, as the case may be, whether the functions of the proposed advisory committee are being or could be performed by one or more agencies or by an advisory committee already in existence, or by enlarging the mandate of an existing advisory committee. Any such legislation shall—

  * (1) contain a clearly defined purpose for the advisory committee;

  * (2) require the membership of the advisory committee to be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee;

  * (3) contain appropriate provisions to assure that the advice and recommendations of the advisory committee will not be inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest, but will instead be the result of the advisory committee's independent judgment;

  * (4) contain provisions dealing with authorization of appropriations, the date for submission of reports (if any), the duration of the advisory committee, and the publication of reports and other materials, to the extent that the standing committee determines the provisions of section 10 of this Act to be inadequate; and

  * (5) contain provisions which will assure that the advisory committee will have adequate staff (either supplied by an agency or employed by it), will be provided adequate quarters, and will have funds available to meet its other necessary expenses.


* (c) To the extent they are applicable, the guidelines set out in subsection (b) of this section shall be followed by the President, agency heads, or other Federal officials in creating an advisory committee.

* (c) The President shall, not later than December 31 of each year, make an annual report to the Congress on the activities, status, and changes in the composition of advisory committees in existence during the preceding fiscal year. The report shall contain the name of every advisory committee, the date of and authority for its creation, its termination date or the date it is to make a report, its functions, a reference to the reports it has submitted, a statement of whether it is an ad hoc or continuing body, the dates of its meetings, the names and occupations of its current members, and the total estimated annual cost to the United States to fund, service, supply, and maintain such committee. Such report shall include a list of those advisory committees abolished by the President, and in the case of advisory committees established by statute, a list of those advisory committees which the President recommends be abolished together with his reasons therefor. The President shall exclude from this report any information which, in his judgment, should be withheld for reasons of national security, and he shall include in such report a statement that such information is excluded.

  * (3) whether it should be merged with other advisory committees; or

  * (4) whether it should be abolished.

Thereafter, the Administrator shall carry out a similar review annually. Agency heads shall cooperate with the Administrator in making the reviews required by this subsection.

* (c) The Administrator shall prescribe administrative guidelines and management controls applicable to advisory committees, and, to the maximum extent feasible, provide advice, assistance, and guidance to advisory committees to improve their performance. In carrying out his functions under this subsection, the Administrator shall consider the recommendations of each agency head with respect to means of improving the performance of advisory committees whose duties are related to such agency.

* (d)(1) The Administrator, after study and consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall establish guidelines with respect to uniform fair rates of pay for comparable services of members, staffs, and consultants of advisory committees in a manner which gives appropriate recognition to the responsibilities and qualifications required and other relevant factors. Such regulations shall provide that—

* (2) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent—

  * (A) an individual who (without regard to his service with an advisory committee) is a full-time employee of the United States, or

  * (B) an individual who immediately before his service with an advisory committee was such an employee,


* from receiving compensation at the rate at which he otherwise would be compensated (or was compensated) as a full-time employee of the United States.
