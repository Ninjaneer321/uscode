* (a) PARTIES.—In an action under section 1346(g) of this title, the defendant shall be the employing office alleged to have committed the violation involved.

* (b) JURY TRIAL.—In an action described in subsection (a), any party may demand a jury trial where a jury trial would be available in an action against a private defendant under the relevant law made applicable by chapter 5 of title 3.
