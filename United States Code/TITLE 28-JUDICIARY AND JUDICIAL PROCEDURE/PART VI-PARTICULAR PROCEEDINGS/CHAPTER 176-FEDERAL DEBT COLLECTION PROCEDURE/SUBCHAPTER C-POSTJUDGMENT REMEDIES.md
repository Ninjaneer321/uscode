A lien created under this paragraph is for the amount necessary to satisfy the judgment, including costs and interest.

* (2) Such lien may be renewed for one additional period of 20 years upon filing a notice of renewal in the same manner as the judgment is filed and shall relate back to the date the judgment is filed if—

  * (A) the notice of renewal is filed before the expiration of the 20-year period to prevent the expiration of the lien; and

  * (B) the court approves the renewal of such lien under this paragraph.

The agency of the United States that is responsible for such grants and loans may promulgate regulations to allow for waiver of this restriction on eligibility for such grants, loans, and funds.

* (d) LEVY OF EXECUTION.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—Levy on property pursuant to a writ of execution issued under this section shall be made in the same manner as levy on property is made pursuant to a writ of attachment issued under section 3102(d).

    * (ii) 10 days after the date of sale of property on which levy is made.

  * (1) BEFORE EXECUTION SALE.—(A) Before execution sale, the United States marshal may return property to the judgment debtor any personal property taken in execution, on—

Such property shall be open for inspection and appraisal, subject to the judgment debtor's reasonable objections, for a reasonable period before the day of sale.

      * (IV) The United States marshal shall serve written notice of public sale by personal delivery, or certified or registered mail, to each person whom the marshal has reasonable cause to believe, after a title search is conducted by the United States, has an interest in property under execution, including lienholders, co-owners, and tenants, at least 25 days before the day of sale, to the last known address of each such person.

    * (B) SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.—(i) Personal property levied on shall be offered for sale on the premises where it is located at the time of levy, at the courthouse of the county, parish or city wherein it is located, or at another location if ordered by the court. Personal property susceptible of being exhibited shall not be sold unless it is present and subject to the view of those attending the sale unless—

      * (I) the property consists of shares of stock in corporations;

      * (II) by reason of the nature of the property, it is impractical to exhibit it; or

Such delivery to the estate shall have the same effect as if accomplished during the lifetime of the purchaser.


    * (B) PURCHASER CONSIDERED INNOCENT PURCHASER WITHOUT NOTICE.—The purchaser of property sold under execution shall be deemed to be an innocent purchaser without notice if the purchaser would have been considered an innocent purchaser without notice had the sale been made voluntarily and in person by the judgment debtor.

* (h) DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS; FURTHER LEVY.—

  * (1) DISTRIBUTION OF SALE PROCEEDS.—(A) The United States marshal shall first deliver to the judgment debtor such amounts to which the judgment debtor is entitled from the sale of partially exempt property.

* then upon motion of the United States and notice to the judgment debtor, the court may, if appropriate, order that the judgment debtor make specified installment payments to the United States. Notice of the motion shall be served on the judgment debtor in the same manner as a summons or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. In fixing the amount of the payments, the court shall take into consideration after a hearing, the income, resources, and reasonable requirements of the judgment debtor and the judgment debtor's dependents, any other payments to be made in satisfaction of judgments against the judgment debtor, and the amount due on the judgment in favor of the United States.

* (b) MODIFICATION OF ORDER.—On motion of the United States or the judgment debtor, and upon a showing that the judgment debtor's financial circumstances have changed or that assets not previously disclosed by the judgment debtor have been discovered, the court may modify the amount of payments, alter their frequency, or require full payment.

    * (C) If the property or a debt is evidenced by a negotiable instrument for the payment of money, a negotiable document of title or a certificate of stock of an association or corporation, the instrument, document, or certificate shall be treated as property capable of delivery and the person holding it shall be the garnishee, except that—

      * (i) subject to clause (ii), in the case of a security which is transferable in the manner set forth in State law, the entity that carries on its books an account in the name of the debtor in which is reflected such security shall be the garnishee; and

    * (A) whether the garnishee has custody, control or possession of such property;

    * (B) a description of such property and the value of such interest;

    * (C) a description of any previous garnishments to which such property is subject and the extent to which any remaining property is not exempt; and

    * (D) the amount of the debt the garnishee anticipates owing to the judgment debtor in the future and whether the period for payment will be weekly or another specified period.

  * (7) DISPOSITION ORDER.—After the garnishee files an answer and if no hearing is requested within the required time period, the court shall promptly enter an order directing the garnishee as to the disposition of the judgment debtor's nonexempt interest in such property. If a hearing is timely requested, the order shall be entered within 5 days after the hearing, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.

  * (8) PRIORITIES.—Judicial orders and garnishments for the support of a person shall have priority over a writ of garnishment issued under this section. As to any other writ of garnishment or levy, a garnishment issued under this section shall have priority over writs which are issued later in time.

Within 10 days after such accounting is received, the judgment debtor or garnishee may file a written objection to the accounting and a request for hearing. The party objecting shall state grounds for the objection. The court shall hold a hearing on the objection within 10 days after the court receives the request for a hearing, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.

  * (10) TERMINATION OF GARNISHMENT.—A garnishment under this chapter is terminated only by—

    * (C) satisfaction of the debt with respect to which the writ is issued.

### §3206. Discharge
* A person who pursuant to an execution or order issued under this chapter by a court pays or delivers to the United States, a United States marshal, or a receiver, money or other personal property in which a judgment debtor has or will have an interest, or so pays a debt such person owes the judgment debtor, is discharged from such debt to the judgment debtor to the extent of the payment or delivery.
