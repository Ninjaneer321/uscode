Such rule shall define affiliate relationships and significant ownership interests.

#### (b) Definitions
* As used in this section:

#### (c) Exemptions
* The Secretary may, in his discretion, consider a request from any person described in subsection (a) of this section for an exemption from the prohibition of this section. In considering any such request, the Secretary may exempt bidding for leases for lands in any area only if the Secretary finds, on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing, that—

  * (1) such lands have extremely high cost exploration or development problems; and

  * (2) exploration and development will not occur on such lands unless such exemption is granted.


* Findings of the Secretary under this subsection shall be final, and shall not be invalidated unless found to be arbitrary or capricious.

#### (d) Unitization of producing fields
* This section shall not be construed to prohibit the unitization of producing fields to increase production or maximize ultimate recovery of oil or natural gas, or both.

#### (e) Report to Congress covering extension of restrictions on joint bidding
