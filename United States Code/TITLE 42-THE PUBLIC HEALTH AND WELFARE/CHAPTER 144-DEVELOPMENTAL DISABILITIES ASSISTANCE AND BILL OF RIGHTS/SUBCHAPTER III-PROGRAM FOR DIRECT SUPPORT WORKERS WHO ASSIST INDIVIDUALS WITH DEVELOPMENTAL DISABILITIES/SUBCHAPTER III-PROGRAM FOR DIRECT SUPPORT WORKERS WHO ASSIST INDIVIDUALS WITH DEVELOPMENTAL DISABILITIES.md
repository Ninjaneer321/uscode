### SUBCHAPTER III—PROGRAM FOR DIRECT SUPPORT WORKERS WHO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

### §15111. Findings
* Congress finds that—

  * (1) direct support workers, especially young adults, have played essential roles in providing the support needed by individuals with developmental disabilities and expanding community options for those individuals;

    * (A) the small population of individuals who are age 18 through 25, an age group that has been attracted to direct support work in the past;

    * (C) the failure of wages in the human services sector to keep pace with wages in other service sectors; and

    * (D) the lack of quality training and career advancement opportunities available to direct support workers; and


  * (3) individuals with developmental disabilities benefit from assistance from direct support workers who are well trained, and benefit from receiving services from professionals who have spent time as direct support workers.
