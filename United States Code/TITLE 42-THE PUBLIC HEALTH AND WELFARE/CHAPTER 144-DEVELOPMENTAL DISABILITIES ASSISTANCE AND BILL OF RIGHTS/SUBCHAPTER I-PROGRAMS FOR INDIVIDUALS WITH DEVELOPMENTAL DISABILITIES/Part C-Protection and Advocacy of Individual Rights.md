The Secretary shall increase each minimum allotment by an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of such minimum allotment (including any increases in such minimum allotment under this paragraph (or a corresponding provision) for prior fiscal years) as the amount that is equal to the difference between—

    * (A) the total amount appropriated under section 15045 of this title for the fiscal year for which the increase in the minimum allotment is being made; minus

    * (B) the total amount appropriated under section 15045 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for the immediately preceding fiscal year,
