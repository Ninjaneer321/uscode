* The Secretary shall prepare (in consultation with groups representing the elderly and with health insurers) and provide for distribution of a notice containing—

  * (1) a clear, simple explanation of the benefits available under this subchapter and the major categories of health care for which benefits are not available under this subchapter,

  * (2) the limitations on payment (including deductibles and coinsurance amounts) that are imposed under this subchapter, and

  * (3) a description of the limited benefits for long-term care services available under this subchapter and generally available under State plans approved under subchapter XIX.

#### (b) Medicare and medigap information
* The Secretary shall provide information via a toll-free telephone number on the programs under this subchapter.

Such toll-free number shall be the toll-free number listed for general information and assistance in the annual notice under subsection (a) instead of the listing of numbers of individual contractors.

#### (c) Contents of notice
