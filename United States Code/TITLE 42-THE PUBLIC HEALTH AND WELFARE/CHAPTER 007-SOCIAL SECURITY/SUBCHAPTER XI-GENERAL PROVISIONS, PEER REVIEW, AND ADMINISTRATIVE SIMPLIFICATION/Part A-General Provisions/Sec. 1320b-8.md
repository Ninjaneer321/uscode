* (2)(A) The Secretary shall grant a waiver of the requirements under subparagraphs (A)(iii) and (C) of paragraph (1) to a hospital or critical access hospital desiring to enter into an agreement with an organ procurement agency other than such hospital's designated organ procurement agency if the Secretary determines that—

  * (i) the waiver is expected to increase organ donation; and
