* The Commissioner of Social Security shall establish and conduct a Blood Donor Locator Service, which shall be used to obtain and transmit to any authorized person (as defined in subsection (h)(1)) the most recent mailing address of any blood donor who, as indicated by the donated blood or products derived therefrom or by the history of the subsequent use of such blood or blood products, has or may have the virus for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in order to inform such donor of the possible need for medical care and treatment.

#### (b) Provision of address information
* Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security receives a request, filed by an authorized person (as defined in subsection (h)(1)), for the mailing address of a donor described in subsection (a) and the Commissioner of Social Security is reasonably satisfied that the requirements of this section have been met with respect to such request, the Commissioner of Social Security shall promptly undertake to provide the requested address information from—

  * (1) the files and records maintained by the Social Security Administration, and

#### (d) Procedures and safeguards
* Any authorized person shall, as a condition for receiving address information from the Blood Donor Locator Service—

  * (1) establish and maintain, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security, a system for standardizing records with respect to any request, the reason for such request, and the date of such request made by or of it and any disclosure of address information made by or to it,

  * (6) destroy such address information and related blood donor records, upon completion of their use in providing the notification for which the information was obtained, so as to make such information and records undisclosable.


* If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that any authorized person has failed to, or does not, meet the requirements of this subsection, the Commissioner of Social Security may, after any proceedings for review established under subsection (f), take such actions as are necessary to ensure such requirements are met, including refusing to disclose address information to such authorized person until the Commissioner of Social Security determines that such requirements have been or will be met. In the case of any authorized person who discloses any address information received pursuant to this section or any related blood donor records to any agent, this subsection shall apply to such authorized person and each such agent (except that, in the case of an agent, any report to the Commissioner of Social Security or other action with respect to the Commissioner of Social Security shall be made or taken through such authorized person). The Commissioner of Social Security shall destroy all related blood donor records in the possession of the Social Security Administration upon completion of their use in transmitting mailing addresses as required under subsection (a), so as to make such records undisclosable.
