### §1320a–7m. Use of predictive modeling and other analytics technologies to identify and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare fee-for-service program
#### (a) Use in the Medicare fee-for-service program
* The Secretary shall use predictive modeling and other analytics technologies (in this section referred to as "predictive analytics technologies") to identify improper claims for reimbursement and to prevent the payment of such claims under the Medicare fee-for-service program.

#### (b) Predictive analytics technologies requirements
* The predictive analytics technologies used by the Secretary shall—

  * (1) capture Medicare provider and Medicare beneficiary activities across the Medicare fee-for-service program to provide a comprehensive view across all providers, beneficiaries, and geographies within such program in order to—

    * (A) identify and analyze Medicare provider networks, provider billing patterns, and beneficiary utilization patterns; and

    * (B) identify and detect any such patterns and networks that represent a high risk of fraudulent activity;


  * (2) be integrated into the existing Medicare fee-for-service program claims flow with minimal effort and maximum efficiency;

  * (3) be able to—

    * (A) analyze large data sets for unusual or suspicious patterns or anomalies or contain other factors that are linked to the occurrence of waste, fraud, or abuse;

    * (B) undertake such analysis before payment is made; and

    * (C) prioritize such identified transactions for additional review before payment is made in terms of the likelihood of potential waste, fraud, and abuse to more efficiently utilize investigative resources;


  * (4) capture outcome information on adjudicated claims for reimbursement to allow for refinement and enhancement of the predictive analytics technologies on the basis of such outcome information, including post-payment information about the eventual status of a claim; and

  * (5) prevent the payment of claims for reimbursement that have been identified as potentially wasteful, fraudulent, or abusive until such time as the claims have been verified as valid.

#### (c) Implementation requirements
* #### (1) Request for proposals
  * Not later than January 1, 2011, the Secretary shall issue a request for proposals to carry out this section during the first year of implementation. To the extent the Secretary determines appropriate—

    * (A) the initial request for proposals may include subsequent implementation years; and

    * (B) the Secretary may issue additional requests for proposals with respect to subsequent implementation years.

* #### (3) Second implementation year
  * Based on the results of the report and recommendation required under subsection (e)(1)(B), the Secretary shall expand the use of predictive analytics technologies on October 1, 2012, to apply to an additional 10 States identified by the Secretary as having the highest risk of waste, fraud, or abuse in the Medicare fee-for-service program, after the States identified under paragraph (2).

* #### (4) Third implementation year
  * Based on the results of the report and recommendation required under subsection (e)(2), the Secretary shall expand the use of predictive analytics technologies on January 1, 2014, to apply to the Medicare fee-for-service program in any State not identified under paragraph (2) or (3) and the commonwealths and territories.

* #### (5) Fourth implementation year
  * Based on the results of the report and recommendation required under subsection (e)(3), the Secretary shall expand the use of predictive analytics technologies, beginning April 1, 2015, to apply to Medicaid and CHIP. To the extent the Secretary determines appropriate, such expansion may be made on a phased-in basis.

* #### (6) Option for refinement and evaluation
  * If, with respect to the first, second, or third implementation year, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services certifies as part of the report required under subsection (e) for that year no or only nominal actual savings to the Medicare fee-for-service program, the Secretary may impose a moratorium, not to exceed 12 months, on the expansion of the use of predictive analytics technologies under this section for the succeeding year in order to refine the use of predictive analytics technologies to achieve more than nominal savings before further expansion. If a moratorium is imposed in accordance with this paragraph, the implementation dates applicable for the succeeding year or years shall be adjusted to reflect the length of the moratorium period.
