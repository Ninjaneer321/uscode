### Division C—Social Impact Demonstration Projects

### §1397n. Purposes
* The purposes of this division are the following:

  * (1) To improve the lives of families and individuals in need in the United States by funding social programs that achieve real results.

  * (2) To redirect funds away from programs that, based on objective data, are ineffective, and into programs that achieve demonstrable, measurable results.
