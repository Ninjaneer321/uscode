  * #### (B) State option to waive requirement for 3 months before receipt of medical assistance
    * A State may, at its option, elect also to apply subparagraph (A) in the case of a family that was receiving such aid for fewer than three months or that had applied for and was eligible for such aid for fewer than 3 months during the 6 immediately preceding months described in such subparagraph.

* #### (2) Notice of benefits
  * Each State, in the notice of termination of aid under part A of subchapter IV sent to a family meeting the requirements of paragraph (1)—

    * (A) shall notify the family of its right to extended medical assistance under this subsection and include in the notice a description of the reporting requirement of subsection (b)(2)(B)(i) and of the circumstances (described in paragraph (3)) under which such extension may be terminated; and

    * (B) shall include a card or other evidence of the family's entitlement to assistance under this subchapter for the period provided in this subsection.

* #### (3) Termination of extension
  * #### (A) No dependent child
    * Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), extension of assistance during the 6-month period described in paragraph (1) to a family shall terminate (during such period) at the close of the first month in which the family ceases to include a child, whether or not the child is (or would if needy be) a dependent child under part A of subchapter IV.

    * A State, at its option, may pay a family's expenses for premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and similar costs for health insurance or other health coverage offered by an employer of the caretaker relative or by an employer of the absent parent of a dependent child. In the case of such coverage offered by an employer of the caretaker relative—

      * (i) the State may require the caretaker relative, as a condition of extension of coverage under this subsection for the caretaker and the caretaker's family, to make application for such employer coverage, but only if—

        * (I) the caretaker relative is not required to make financial contributions for such coverage (whether through payroll deduction, payment of deductibles, coinsurance, or similar costs, or otherwise), and

        * (II) the State provides, directly or otherwise, for payment of any of the premium amount, deductible, coinsurance, or similar expense that the employee is otherwise required to pay; and


      * (ii) the State shall treat the coverage under such an employer plan as a third party liability (under section 1396a(a)(25) of this title).


  * Payments for premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and similar expenses under this subparagraph shall be considered, for purposes of section 1396b(a) of this title, to be payments for medical assistance.

A State may permit such additional extended assistance under this subsection notwithstanding a failure to report under this clause if the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to report on a timely basis.

      * If the family fails to pay any premium for a month under paragraph (5) by the 21st day of the following month, the extension shall terminate at the close of that following month, unless the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to pay such premium on a timely basis.

        * (I) the family fails to report to the State, by the 21st day of such month, the information required under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), unless the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to report on a timely basis;

        * (II) the caretaker relative had no earnings in one or more of the previous 3 months, unless such lack of any earnings was due to an involuntary loss of employment, illness, or other good cause, established to the satisfaction of the State; or

The State shall make determinations under clause (iii)(III) for a family each time a report under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) for the family is received.

  * #### (B) Notice before termination
    * No termination of assistance shall become effective under subparagraph (A) until the State has provided the family with notice of the grounds for the termination, which notice shall include (in the case of termination under subparagraph (A)(iii)(II), relating to no continued earnings) a description of how the family may reestablish eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan. No such termination shall be effective earlier than 10 days after the date of mailing of such notice.

A State's payment of premiums for the enrollment of families under this subparagraph (not including any premiums otherwise payable by an employer and less the amount of premiums collected from such families under paragraph (5)) and payment of any deductibles and coinsurance shall be considered, for purposes of section 1396b(a)(1) of this title, to be payments for medical assistance.
