#### (b) Requirements
* The experiments and demonstration projects developed under subsection (a) shall be of sufficient scope and shall be carried out on a wide enough scale to permit a thorough evaluation of the alternative methods under consideration while giving assurance that the results derived from the experiments and projects will obtain generally in the operation of the disability insurance program under this subchapter without committing such program to the adoption of any particular system either locally or nationally.

The Commissioner may test multiple minimum threshold amounts.

  * #### (C) Exception for itemized impairment-related work expenses
