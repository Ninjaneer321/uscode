### SUBCHAPTER I—ELECTRIC UTILITY RATE DESIGN INITIATIVES

### §6801. Congressional findings and purpose
* (a) The Congress finds that improvement in electric utility rate design has great potential for reducing the cost of electric utility services to consumers and current and projected shortages of capital, and for encouraging energy conservation and better use of existing electrical generating facilities.

* (b) It is the purpose of this subchapter to require the Secretary to develop proposals for improvement of electric utility rate design and transmit such proposals to Congress; to fund electric utility rate demonstration projects; to intervene or participate, upon request, in the proceedings of utility regulatory commissions; and to provide financial assistance to State offices of consumer services to facilitate presentation of consumer interests before such commissions.

### §6802. Definitions
* As used in this subchapter:

  * (1) The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Energy.

  * (2) The term "electric utility" means any person, State agency, or Federal agency which sells electric energy.

  * (3) The term "Federal agency" means any agency or instrumentality of the United States.

  * (4) The term "State agency" means a State, political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of either.

  * (5) The term "State utility regulatory commission" means (A) any utility regulatory commission which is a State agency or (B) the Tennessee Valley Authority.

  * (6) The term "State" means any State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States.

  * (7) The term "utility regulatory commission" means any State agency or Federal agency which has authority to fix, modify, approve, or disapprove rates for the sale of electric energy by any electric utility (other than by such agency).

### §6803. Development of electric utility rate design proposals by Secretary; contents; submission to Congress; supporting analysis
* (a) The Secretary shall develop proposals to improve electric utility rate design. Such proposals shall be designed to encourage energy conservation, minimize the need for new electrical generating capacity, and minimize costs of electric energy to consumers, and shall include (but not be limited to) proposals which provide for the development and implementation of—

  * (1) load management techniques which are cost effective;

  * (2) rates which reflect marginal cost of service, or time of use of service, or both;

  * (3) ratemaking policies which discourage inefficient use of fuel and encourage economical purchases of fuel; and

  * (4) rates (or other regulatory policies) which encourage electric utility system reliability and reliability of major items of electric utility equipment.


* (b) The proposals prepared under subsection (a) shall be transmitted to each House of Congress not later than 6 months after August 14, 1976, for review and for such further action as the Congress may direct by law. Such proposals shall be accompanied by an analysis of—

  * (1) the projected savings (if any) in consumption of petroleum products, natural gas, electric energy, and other energy resources,

  * (2) the reduction (if any) in the need for new electrical generating capacity, and of the demand for capital by the electric utility industry, and

  * (3) changes (if any) in the cost of electric energy to consumers,


* which are likely to result from the implementation nationally of each of the proposals transmitted under this subsection.

### §6804. Funding, administrative, and judicial authorities of Secretary
* The Secretary may—

  * (1) fund (A) demonstration projects to improve electric utility load management procedures and (B) regulatory rate reform initiatives,
