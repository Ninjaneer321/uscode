### SUBCHAPTER IV—MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

### §9161. Law of the Sea Treaty
* If the United States ratifies a treaty, which includes provisions with respect to jurisdiction over ocean thermal energy conversion activities, resulting from any United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the Administrator, after consultation with the Secretary of State, shall promulgate any amendment to the regulations promulgated under this chapter which is necessary and appropriate to conform such regulations to the provisions of such treaty, in anticipation of the date when such treaty shall come into force and effect for, or otherwise be applicable to, the United States.

### §9162. International negotiations
* The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Administrator and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall seek effective international action and cooperation in support of the policy and purposes of this chapter and may initiate and conduct negotiations for the purpose of entering into international agreements designed to guarantee noninterference of ocean thermal energy conversion facilities and plantships with the thermal gradients used by other such facilities and plantships, to assure protection of such facilities and plantships and of navigational safety in the vicinity thereof, and to resolve such other matters relating to ocean thermal energy conversion facilities and plantships as need to be resolved in international agreements.

### §9163. Relationship to other laws
#### (a) Facilities and plantships as comparable to areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State
* (1) The Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States shall apply to an ocean thermal energy conversion facility or plantship licensed under this chapter and all of which is located seaward of the highwater mark, and to activities connected, associated, or potentially interfering with the use or operation of any such facility or plantship, in the same manner as if such facility or plantship were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve, exempt, or immunize any person from any other requirement imposed by Federal law, regulation, or treaty.

* (2) Ocean thermal energy conversion facilities and plantships licensed under this chapter do not possess the status of islands and have no territorial seas of their own.

#### (b) Responsibilities and authorities of States or United States within territorial seas; applicability of State law to facilities located beyond territorial seas
* (1) Except as may otherwise be provided by this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall in any way alter the responsibilities and authorities of a State or the United States within the territorial seas of the United States.

* (2) The law of the nearest adjacent coastal State to which an ocean thermal energy conversion facility located beyond the territorial sea and licensed under this chapter is connected by electric transmission cable or pipeline, now in effect or hereafter adopted, amended, or repealed, is declared to be the law of the United States, and shall apply to such facility, to the extent applicable and not inconsistent with any provision or regulation under this chapter or other Federal laws and regulations now in effect or hereafter adopted, amended, or repealed: _Provided, however_, That the application of State taxation laws is not extended hereby outside the seaward boundary of any State. All such applicable laws shall be administered and enforced by the appropriate officers and courts of the United States outside the seaward boundary of any State.

#### (c) Customs laws
* (1) For the purposes of the customs laws administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, ocean thermal energy conversion facilities and plantships documented under the laws of the United States and licensed under this chapter shall be deemed to be vessels.

* (2) Except insofar as they apply to vessels documented under the laws of the United States, the customs laws administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, including the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1202), and other laws codified in title 19, shall not apply to any ocean thermal energy conversion facility or plantship documented under the laws of the United States and licensed under the provisions of this chapter, but all foreign articles to be used in the construction of any such facility or plantship, including any component thereof, shall first be made subject to all applicable duties and taxes which would be imposed upon or by reason of their importation if they were imported for consumption in the United States. Duties and taxes shall be paid thereon in accordance with laws applicable to merchandise imported into the customs territory of the United States.

### §9164. Submarine electric transmission cable and equipment safety
#### (a) Standards and regulations
* The Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with other interested Federal agencies and departments, shall establish and enforce such standards and regulations as may be necessary to assure the safe construction and operation of submarine electric transmission cables and equipment subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Such standards and regulations shall include, but not be limited to, requirements for the use of the safest and best available technology for submarine electric transmission cable shielding, and for the use of automatic switches to shut off electric current in the event of a break in such a cable.

#### (b) Report to Congress on appropriation and staffing needs
* The Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with other interested Federal agencies and departments, is authorized and directed to report to the Congress within 60 days after August 3, 1980, on appropriations and staffing needed to monitor submarine electric transmission cables and equipment subject to the jurisdiction of the United States so as to assure that they meet all applicable standards for construction, operation, and maintenance.

### §9166. Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Commerce, for the use of the Administrator in carrying out the provisions of this chapter, not to exceed $3,000,000 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, not to exceed $3,500,000 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, not to exceed $3,500,000 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1983, not to exceed $480,000 for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1984 and September 30, 1985, and not to exceed $630,000 for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1986 and September 30, 1987.

### §9167. Severability
* If any provision of this chapter or any application thereof is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the chapter, or any other application, shall not be affected thereby.

### §9168. Report to Congress on promotion and enhancement of export potential of ocean thermal energy conversion components, facilities, and plantships
* Within 18 months after November 8, 1984, the Administrator shall submit to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report detailing what steps the United States Government is taking and plans to take to promote and enhance the export potential of ocean thermal energy conversion components, facilities, and plantships manufactured by United States industry. Such report shall include—

  * (1) the relevant views of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, International Trade Administration, Maritime Administration, Department of Energy, Small Business Administration, United States International Development Cooperative Agency, the Office of the Special Trade Representative, and other relevant United States Government agencies;

  * (2) the findings of studies conducted by the Administrator to fulfill the intent of this section;

  * (3) a summary of activities, including consultations held with representatives of both the ocean thermal energy conversion and financial industries conducted by the Administrator to fulfill the intent of this section; and

  * (4) such recommendations as the Administrator deems appropriate for amending this chapter or other relevant Acts to better promote and enhance the export potential of ocean thermal energy conversion components, facilities and plantships manufactured by United States industry.
