  * (C) state the known reasons for the consent not being provided;

  * (D) set forth the conditions and compensation, if any, offered by the applicant as part of the efforts to obtain consent; and

  * (E) provide prima facie evidence that the method of stimulation proposed by the coalbed methane operator will not (i) cause unreasonable loss or damage to the coal seam considering all factors, including the prospect, taking into consideration the economics of the coal industry, that coal seams for which no actual or proposed mining plans exist will be mined at some future date, or (ii) violate mine safety requirements. If a denial of consent by a coal operator is based on reasons related to safety, the Secretary of the Interior shall seek the views and recommendations of the appropriate State or Federal coal mine safety agency. Any determination by the Secretary of the Interior shall be in accordance with all applicable Federal and State coal mine safety laws and such views and recommendations. A determination by the Secretary of the Interior approving a method of stimulation may include reasonable conditions including, but not limited to, conditions to mitigate, to the extent practicable, economic damage to the coal seam. Any determination approving or denying a method of stimulation by the Secretary of the Interior shall be subject to appeal. Interested entities shall be allowed to participate in and comment on proceedings under this paragraph.


* (3) The Secretary of the Interior shall by rule establish, for an Affected State, a region thereof, or a multi-State region comprised of Affected States, the boundaries within which a coalbed methane operator shall be required to obtain written consent from a coal operator pursuant to paragraph (1). Such boundaries shall be stated in terms of a horizontal and a vertical distance from the point of stimulation and shall be determined based on an evaluation of the maximum length, height and depth of fracture producible in a coal seam in such Affected State, region thereof, or multi-State region comprised of Affected States.

* (4) The consent required under this subsection shall in no way be deemed to impair, abridge, or affect any contractual rights or objections arising out of a coalbed methane gas contract or coalbed methane gas lease in existence as of October 24, 1992, between the coalbed methane operator and the coal operator, and the existence of such lease or contractual agreement and any extensions or renewals of such lease shall be deemed to fully meet the requirements of this section.

* (5) Nothing in this subsection precludes either a coal operator or a coalbed methane operator from seeking in the appropriate State forum compensation for the consequences of a determination by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to paragraph (2).

#### (k) Notice and objection
* (1) The Secretary of the Interior shall not approve the drilling of any coalbed methane well unless the unit operator has notified each entity which is operating, or has the ability, by virtue of his property rights in the coal, to operate, a coal mine in any portion of the coalbed that would be affected by such well within the distances established pursuant to the rules promulgated under subsection (j)(3). Any notified entity may object to the drilling of such well within 30 days after receipt of a notice. Upon receipt of a timely objection to the drilling of any coalbed methane gas well submitted by a notified entity, the Secretary of the Interior may refuse to approve the drilling of the well based on any of the following:

  * (A) The proposed activity, due to its proximity to any coal mine opening, shaft, underground workings, or to any proposed extension of the coal mine, would adversely affect any operating, inactive or abandoned coal mine, including any coal mine already surveyed and platted but not yet being operated.

  * (B) The proposed activity would not conform with a coal operator's development plan for an existing or proposed operation.

  * (C) There would be an unreasonable interference from the proposed activity with present or future coal mining operations, including the ability to comply with other applicable laws and regulations.

  * (D) The presence of evidence indicating that the proposed drilling activities would be unsafe, taking into consideration the dangers from creeps, squeezes or other disturbances due to the extraction of coal.

  * (E) The proposed activity would unreasonably interfere with the safe recovery of coal, oil and gas.


* (2) In the event the Secretary of the Interior does not approve the drilling of a coalbed methane well pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Interior shall consider whether such drilling could be approved if the unit operator modifies the proposed activities to take into account any of the following:

  * (A) The proposed activity could instead be reasonably done through an existing or planned pillar of coal, or in close proximity to an existing well or such pillar of coal, taking into consideration surface topography.

  * (B) The proposed activity could instead be moved to a mined-out area, below the coal outcrop or to some other feasible area.

  * (C) The unit operator agrees to a drilling moratorium of not more than two years in order to permit completion of coal mining operations.

  * (D) The practicality of locating the proposed spacing unit or well on a uniform pattern with other spacing units or wells.

#### (l) Plugging
* All coalbed methane wells drilled after October 24, 1992, that penetrate coal seams with remaining reserves shall provide for subsequent safe mining through the well in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with any Federal and State agencies having authority over coal mine safety. Well plugging costs should be allocated in accordance with State law or private contractual arrangement, as the case may be.

#### (m) Notice and objection by other parties
* The Secretary of the Interior shall not approve the drilling of any coalbed methane well unless such well complies with the spacing and other requirements established by the Secretary of the Interior and each of the following:

  * (1) The unit operator of such well has notified, or has made a reasonable and diligent effort to notify, all entities claiming ownership of coalbed methane to be drained by such well and provided an opportunity to object in accordance with requirements established by the Secretary of the Interior.

  * (2) Where conflicting interests exist, an order under subsection (g) establishing pooling requirements has been issued.


* The notification requirements of this subsection shall be additional to the notification referred to in subsection (k). The Secretary of the Interior shall establish the conditions under which entities claiming ownership of coalbed methane may object to the drilling of a coalbed methane well.

#### (n) Venting for safety
* Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or inhibit the entity which has the right to develop and mine coal in any mine from venting coalbed methane gas to ensure safe mine operations.

#### (o) Other laws
* The Secretary of the Interior shall comply with all applicable Federal and State coal mine safety laws and regulations.

#### (p) Definitions
* As used in this section—

  * (1) The term "Affected State" means a State listed by the Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, under subsection (b).

  * (2) The term "coalbed methane gas" means occluded natural gas produced (or which may be produced) from coalbeds and rock strata associated therewith.

  * (3) The term "unit operator" means the entity designated in a pooling order to develop a spacing unit by the drilling of one or more wells on the unit.

  * (4) The term "nonparticipating working interest owner" means a gas or oil owner of a tract included in a spacing unit which elects to share in the operation of the well on a carried basis by agreeing to have its proportionate share of the costs allocable to its interest charged against its share of production of the well in accordance with subsection (f)(3).

  * (5) The term "participating working interest owner" means a gas or oil owner which elects to bear a share of the risks and costs of drilling, completing, equipping, gathering, operating (including any and all disposal costs) plugging, and abandoning a well on a spacing unit and to receive a share of production from the well equal to the proportion which the acreage in the spacing unit it owns or holds under lease bears to the total acreage of the spacing unit.

  * (6) The term "coal seam" means any stratum of coal 20 inches or more in thickness, unless a stratum of less thickness is being commercially worked, or can in the judgment of the Secretary of the Interior forseeably be commercially worked and will require protection if wells are being drilled through it.

### §13369. Establishment of data base and study of transportation rates
#### (a) Data base
* The Secretary shall review the information currently collected by the Federal Government and shall determine whether information on transportation rates for rail and pipeline transport of domestic coal, oil, and gas during the period of January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1997, is reasonably available. If he determines that such information is not reasonably available, the Secretary shall establish a data base containing, to the maximum extent practicable, information on all such rates. The confidentiality of contract rates shall be preserved. To obtain data pertaining to rail contract rates, the Secretary shall acquire such data in aggregate form only from the Surface Transportation Board, under terms and conditions that maintain the confidentiality of such rates.

#### (b) Study
* The Energy Information Administration shall determine the extent to which any agency of the Federal Government is studying the rates and distribution patterns of domestic coal, oil, and gas to determine the impact of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] as amended by the Act entitled "An Act to amend the Clean Air Act to provide for attainment and maintenance of health protective national ambient air quality standards, and for other purposes.", enacted November 15, 1990 (Public Law 101–549), and other Federal policies on such rates and distribution patterns. If the Energy Information Administration finds that no such study is underway, or that reports of the results of such study will not be available to the Congress providing the information specified in this subsection and subsection (a) by the dates established in subsection (c), the Energy Information Administration shall initiate such a study.

#### (c) Reports to Congress
* Within one year after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall report to the Congress on the determination the Energy Information Administration is required to make under subsection (b). Within three years after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall submit reports on any data base or study developed under this section. Any such reports shall be updated and resubmitted to the Congress within eight years after October 24, 1992. If the Energy Information Administration has determined pursuant to subsection (b) that another study or studies will provide all or part of the information called for in this section, the Secretary shall transmit the results of that study by the dates established in this subsection, together with his comments.

#### (d) Consultation with other agencies
* The Secretary and the Energy Information Administration shall consult with the Chairmen of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Surface Transportation Board in implementing this section.

### §13370. Authorization of appropriations
