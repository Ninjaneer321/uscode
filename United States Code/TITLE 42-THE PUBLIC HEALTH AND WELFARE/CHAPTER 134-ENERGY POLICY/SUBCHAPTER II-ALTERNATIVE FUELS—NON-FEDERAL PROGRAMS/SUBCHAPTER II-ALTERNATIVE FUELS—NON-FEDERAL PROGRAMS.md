### SUBCHAPTER II—ALTERNATIVE FUELS—NON-FEDERAL PROGRAMS

### §13231. Public information program
* The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and individuals and organizations with practical experience in the production and use of alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles, shall, for the purposes of promoting the use of alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles, establish a public information program on the benefits and costs of the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles. Within 18 months after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall produce and make available an information package for consumers to assist them in choosing among alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles. Such information package shall provide relevant and objective information on motor vehicle characteristics and fuel characteristics as compared to gasoline, on a life cycle basis, including environmental performance, energy efficiency, domestic content, cost, maintenance requirements, reliability, and safety. Such information package shall also include information with respect to the conversion of conventional motor vehicles to alternative fueled vehicles. The Secretary shall include such other information as the Secretary determines is reasonable and necessary to help promote the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles. Such information package shall be updated annually to reflect the most recent available information.

### §13232. Labeling requirements
#### (a) Establishment of requirements
* The Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Secretary, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Secretary of Transportation, shall, within 18 months after October 24, 1992, issue a notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule to establish uniform labeling requirements, to the greatest extent practicable, for alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles, including requirements for appropriate information with respect to costs and benefits, so as to reasonably enable the consumer to make choices and comparisons. Required labeling under the rule shall be simple and, where appropriate, consolidated with other labels providing information to the consumer. In formulating the rule, the Federal Trade Commission shall give consideration to the problems associated with developing and publishing useful and timely cost and benefit information, taking into account lead time, costs, the frequency of changes in costs and benefits that may occur, and other relevant factors. The Commission shall obtain the views of affected industries, consumer organizations, Federal and State agencies, and others in formulating the rule. A final rule shall be issued within 1 year after the notice of proposed rulemaking is issued. Such rule shall be updated periodically to reflect the most recent available information.

#### (b) Technical assistance and coordination
* The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to the Federal Trade Commission in developing labeling requirements under subsection (a). The Secretary shall coordinate activities under this section with activities under section 13231 of this title.

### §13233. Data acquisition program
* (a) Not later than one year after October 24, 1992, the Secretary, through the Energy Information Administration, and in cooperation with appropriate State, regional, and local authorities, shall establish a data collection program to be conducted in at least 5 geographically and climatically diverse regions of the United States for the purpose of collecting data which would be useful to persons seeking to manufacture, convert, sell, own, or operate alternative fueled vehicles or alternative fueling facilities. Such data shall include—

  * (1) identification of the number and types of motor vehicle trips made daily and miles driven per trip, including commuting, business, and recreational trips;

  * (2) the projections of the Secretary as to the most likely combination of alternative fueled vehicle use and other forms of transit, including rail and other forms of mass transit;

  * (3) cost, performance, environmental, energy, and safety data on alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles; and

  * (4) other appropriate demographic information and consumer preferences.

To the maximum extent practicable, through the establishment of cofunding requirements applicable to such projects, the Commission shall ensure that the costs of such activities shall be provided in part, through contributions of cash, personnel, services, equipment, and other resources, by sources other than the recovery of expenses pursuant to this section.

#### (b) Electric motor vehicles
* The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may, under section 824d of title 16, allow recovery of expenses in advance by electric utilities for research, development, and demonstration activities by the Electric Power Research Institute for projects on electric motor vehicles, if the Commission finds that the benefits, including environmental benefits, to existing and future ratepayers resulting from such activities exceed all direct costs to existing and future ratepayers. To the maximum extent practicable, through the establishment of cofunding requirements applicable to each project, the costs of such activities shall be provided, in part, through contributions of cash, personnel, services, equipment, and other resources, by sources other than the recovery of expenses pursuant to this section.

### §13235. State and local incentives programs
