    * (A) to facilitate increased efficiency of enhanced safety, advanced light water reactors to produce electric power at the lowest cost to the customer;

    * (B) to develop advanced reactor concepts that are passively safe and environmentally acceptable; and

    * (C) to complete necessary research and development on high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technology and liquid metal reactor technology to support the selection, by September 30, 1998, of one or both of those technologies as appropriate for prototype demonstration; and


  * (3) for the long-term, to complete research and development and demonstration to support the design of advanced reactor technologies capable of providing electric power to a utility grid as soon as practicable but no later than the year 2010.

#### (c) Program plan
* Within 180 days after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Congress a 5-year program plan to guide the activities under this section. The program plan shall include schedule milestones, Federal funding requirements, and non-Federal cost sharing requirements. In preparing the program plan, the Secretary shall take into consideration—

  * (1) the need for, and the potential for future adoption by electric utilities or other entities of, advanced nuclear reactor technologies that are available, under development, or have the potential for being developed, for the generation of energy from nuclear fission;

  * (2) how the Federal Government, acting through the Secretary, can be effective in ensuring the availability of such technologies when they are needed;

  * (3) how the Federal Government can most effectively cooperate with the private sector in the accomplishment of the goals set forth in subsection (b); and

  * (4) potential alternative funding sources for carrying out this section.


* In preparing the program plan, the Secretary shall consult with appropriate representatives of industry, institutions of higher education, Federal agencies, including national laboratories, and professional and technical societies. The Secretary shall update the program plan annually and submit such update to Congress. Each such update shall describe any activities that are behind schedule, any funding shortfalls, and any other circumstances that might affect the ability of the Secretary to meet the goals set forth in subsection (b).

### §13493. Commercialization of advanced light water reactor technology
#### (a) Certification of designs
* In order to achieve the goal of certification of completed standardized designs by the Commission by 1996 as set forth in section 13492(b) of this title, the Secretary shall conduct a 5-year program of technical and financial assistance to encourage the development and submission for certification of advanced light water reactor designs which, in the judgment of the Secretary, can be certified by the Commission by no later than the end of fiscal year 1996.

#### (b) First-of-a-kind engineering
* #### (1) Establishment of program
  * The Secretary shall conduct a program of Federal financial and technical assistance for the first-of-a-kind engineering design of standardized commercial nuclear powerplants which are included, as of October 24, 1992, in the Department of Energy's program for certification of advanced light water reactor designs.
