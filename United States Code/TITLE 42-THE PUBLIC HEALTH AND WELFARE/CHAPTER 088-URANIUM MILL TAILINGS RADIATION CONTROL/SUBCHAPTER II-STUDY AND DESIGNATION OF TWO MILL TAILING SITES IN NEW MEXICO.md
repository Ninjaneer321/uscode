### SUBCHAPTER II—STUDY AND DESIGNATION OF TWO MILL TAILING SITES IN NEW MEXICO

### §7941. Study of authority for regulation and control of residual radioactive materials at New Mexico sites for protection of public health, safety, and the environment; report to Congress and Secretary; basis for determination of inadequacy of authority; interim regulation pending completion of study
* The Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Attorney General of the State of New Mexico, shall conduct a study to determine the extent and adequacy of the authority of the Commission and the State of New Mexico to require, under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended by title II of this Act) [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.] or under State authority as permitted under section 274 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 2021] or under other provision of law, the owners of the following active uranium mill sites to undertake appropriate action to regulate and control all residual radioactive materials at such sites to protect public health, safety, and the environment: the former Homestake-New Mexico Partners site near Milan, New Mexico, and the Anaconda carbonate process tailings site near Bluewater, New Mexico. Such study shall be completed and a report thereof submitted to the Congress and to the Secretary within one year after November 8, 1978, together with such recommendations as may be appropriate. If the Commission determines that such authority is not adequate to regulate and control such materials at such sites in the manner provided in the first sentence of this section, the Commission shall include in the report a statement of the basis for such determination. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or delay action by a State as permitted under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2021] or under any other provision of law or by the Commission to regulate such residual radioactive materials at such sites prior to completion of such study.

### §7942. Designation by Secretary as processing sites for subchapter I purposes
#### (a) New Mexico cooperative agreement respecting certain residual radioactive materials; submission to Congressional committees
* Within ninety days from the date of his receipt of the report and recommendations submitted by the Commission under section 7941 of this title, notwithstanding the limitations contained in section 7911(6)(A) and in section 7925(a) of this title, if the Commission determines, based on such study, that such sites cannot be regulated and controlled by the State or the Commission in the manner described in section 7941 of this title, the Secretary may designate either or both of the sites referred to in section 7941 of this title as a processing site for purposes of subchapter I. Following such designation, the Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with New Mexico to perform remedial action pursuant to such subchapter I concerning only the residual radioactive materials at such site resulting from uranium produced for sale to a Federal agency prior to January 1, 1971, under contract with such agency. Any such designation shall be submitted by the Secretary, together with his estimate of the cost of carrying out such remedial action at the designated site, to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.

#### (b) Effective date
* (1) No designation under subsection (a) shall take effect before the expiration of one hundred and twenty calendar days (not including any day in which either House of Congress is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three calendar days to a day certain or an adjournment sine die) after receipt by such Committees of such designation.

#### (c) Subchapter I provisions applicable
* Except as otherwise specifically provided in subsection (a) of this section, any remedial action under subchapter I with respect to any sites designated under this subchapter shall be subject to the provisions of subchapter I (including the authorization of appropriations referred to in section 7922(b) of this title).
