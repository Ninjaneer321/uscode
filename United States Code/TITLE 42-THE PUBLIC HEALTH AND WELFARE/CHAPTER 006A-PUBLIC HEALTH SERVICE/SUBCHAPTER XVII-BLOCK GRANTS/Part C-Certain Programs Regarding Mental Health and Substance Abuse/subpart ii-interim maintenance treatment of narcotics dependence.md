  * (1) to dispense methadone for treatment purposes to individuals who—

    * (A) meet the conditions for admission to such programs that dispense methadone as part of comprehensive treatment for such dependence; and

    * (B) are seeking admission to such programs that so dispense methadone, but as a result of the limited capacity of the programs, will not gain such admission until 14 or more days after seeking admission to the programs; and


  * (2) in dispensing methadone to such individuals, to provide only minimum ancillary services during the period in which the individuals are waiting for admission to programs of comprehensive treatment.

Such conditions shall include conditions for preventing the unauthorized use of methadone.

* #### (2) Counseling on HIV disease
  * The regulations issued under paragraph (1) shall provide that an authorization described in such paragraph may not be issued to a treatment program unless the program provides to recipients of the treatment counseling on preventing exposure to and the transmission of HIV disease.

* #### (3) Permission of relevant State as condition of authorization
