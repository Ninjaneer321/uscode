### SUBPART 12—NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES

### §285_l_. Purpose of Institute
* The general purpose of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (in this subpart referred to as the "Institute") is the conduct and support of research, training, health information dissemination, and other programs with respect to factors in the environment that affect human health, directly or indirectly.

### §285_l_–1. Applied Toxicological Research and Testing Program
* (a) There is established within the Institute a program for conducting applied research and testing regarding toxicology, which program shall be known as the Applied Toxicological Research and Testing Program.

* (b) In carrying out the program established under subsection (a), the Director of the Institute shall, with respect to toxicology, carry out activities—

  * (1) to expand knowledge of the health effects of environmental agents;

  * (2) to broaden the spectrum of toxicology information that is obtained on selected chemicals;

  * (3) to develop and validate assays and protocols, including alternative methods that can reduce or eliminate the use of animals in acute or chronic safety testing;

  * (4) to establish criteria for the validation and regulatory acceptance of alternative testing and to recommend a process through which scientifically validated alternative methods can be accepted for regulatory use;

  * (5) to communicate the results of research to government agencies, to medical, scientific, and regulatory communities, and to the public; and

  * (6) to integrate related activities of the Department of Health and Human Services.

### §285_l_–2. Definitions
* In sections 285l–2 to 285l–5 of this title:

* #### (1) Alternative test method
  * The term "alternative test method" means a test method that—

    * (A) includes any new or revised test method; and

    * (B)(i) reduces the number of animals required;

    * (ii) refines procedures to lessen or eliminate pain or distress to animals, or enhances animal well-being; or

    * (iii) replaces animals with non-animal systems or one animal species with a phylogenetically lower animal species, such as replacing a mammal with an invertebrate.

* #### (2) ICCVAM test recommendation
  * The term "ICCVAM test recommendation" means a summary report prepared by the ICCVAM characterizing the results of a scientific expert peer review of a test method.

### §285_l_–3. Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods

### §285_l_–4. Federal agency action
#### (a) Identification of tests
* With respect to each Federal agency carrying out a program that requires or recommends acute or chronic toxicological testing, such agency shall, not later than 180 days after receiving an ICCVAM test recommendation, identify and forward to the ICCVAM any relevant test method specified in a regulation or industry-wide guideline which specifically, or in practice requires, recommends, or encourages the use of an animal acute or chronic toxicological test method for which the ICCVAM test recommendation may be added or substituted.

#### (b) Alternatives
* Each Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) shall promote and encourage the development and use of alternatives to animal test methods (including batteries of tests and test screens), where appropriate, for the purpose of complying with Federal statutes, regulations, guidelines, or recommendations (in each instance, and for each chemical class) if such test methods are found to be effective for generating data, in an amount and of a scientific value that is at least equivalent to the data generated from existing tests, for hazard identification, dose-response assessment, or risk assessment purposes.

#### (c) Test method validation
* Each Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) shall ensure that any new or revised acute or chronic toxicity test method, including animal test methods and alternatives, is determined to be valid for its proposed use prior to requiring, recommending, or encouraging the application of such test method.

#### (d) Review
* Not later than 180 days after receipt of an ICCVAM test recommendation, a Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) shall review such recommendation and notify the ICCVAM in writing of its findings.

#### (e) Recommendation adoption
* Each Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a), or its specific regulatory unit or units, shall adopt the ICCVAM test recommendation unless such Federal agency determines that—

  * (1) the ICCVAM test recommendation is not adequate in terms of biological relevance for the regulatory goal authorized by that agency, or mandated by Congress;

  * (2) the ICCVAM test recommendation does not generate data, in an amount and of a scientific value that is at least equivalent to the data generated prior to such recommendation, for the appropriate hazard identification, dose-response assessment, or risk assessment purposes as the current test method recommended or required by that agency;

  * (3) the agency does not employ, recommend, or require testing for that class of chemical or for the recommended test endpoint; or

  * (4) the ICCVAM test recommendation is unacceptable for satisfactorily fulfilling the test needs for that particular agency and its respective congressional mandate.
