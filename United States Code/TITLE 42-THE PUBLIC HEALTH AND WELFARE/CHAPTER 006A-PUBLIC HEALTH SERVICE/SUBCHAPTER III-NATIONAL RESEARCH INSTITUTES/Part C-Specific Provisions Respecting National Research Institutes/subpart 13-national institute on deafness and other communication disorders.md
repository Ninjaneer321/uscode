  * (3) research into prevention, and early detection and diagnosis, of hearing loss and speech and language disturbances (including stuttering) and research into preventing the effects of such disorders on learning and learning disabilities with extension of programs for appropriate referral and rehabilitation;

  * (4) research into the detection, treatment, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes in the growing elderly population with extension of rehabilitative programs to ensure continued effective communication skills in such population;

  * (5) research to expand knowledge of the effects of environmental agents that influence hearing or other communication processes; and

  * (6) developing and facilitating intramural programs on clinical and fundamental aspects of disorders of hearing and all other communication processes.
