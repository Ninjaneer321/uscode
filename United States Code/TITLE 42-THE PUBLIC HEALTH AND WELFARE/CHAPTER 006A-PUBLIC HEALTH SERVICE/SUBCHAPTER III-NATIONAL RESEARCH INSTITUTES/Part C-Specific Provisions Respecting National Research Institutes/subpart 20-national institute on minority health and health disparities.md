* The Director of the Institute shall in expending amounts appropriated under this subpart give priority to conducting and supporting minority health disparities research.

#### (c) Minority health disparities research
* For purposes of this subpart:

  * (1) The term "minority health disparities research" means basic, clinical, and behavioral research on minority health conditions (as defined in paragraph (2)), including research to prevent, diagnose, and treat such conditions.

  * (2) The term "minority health conditions", with respect to individuals who are members of minority groups, means all diseases, disorders, and conditions (including with respect to mental health and substance abuse)—

    * (A) unique to, more serious, or more prevalent in such individuals;

    * (B) for which the factors of medical risk or types of medical intervention may be different for such individuals, or for which it is unknown whether such factors or types are different for such individuals; or

    * (C) with respect to which there has been insufficient research involving such individuals as subjects or insufficient data on such individuals.


  * (3) The term "minority group" has the meaning given the term "racial and ethnic minority group" in section 300u–6 of this title.

  * (4) The terms "minority" and "minorities" refer to individuals from a minority group.
