    * (B) make available to the public the results of the inspection,

    * (C) conduct additional inspections of other embryo laboratories under paragraph (1) to determine if—

      * (i) such State in carrying out the certification program is reliably identifying the deficiencies of such laboratory, or

      * (ii) the accreditation organization which certified such laboratories is reliably identifying such deficencies, and


    * (D) if the Secretary determines—

      * (i) that such State in carrying out the certification program has not met the requirements applicable to such program, or

      * (ii) the accreditation organization which certified such laboratory has not met the requirements of section 263a–3 of this title,


* the Secretary may revoke the approval of the State certification program or revoke the approval of such accreditation organization.

#### (i) Limitation
* #### (1) Secretary
  * In developing the certification program, the Secretary may not establish any regulation, standard, or requirement which has the effect of exercising supervision or control over the practice of medicine in assisted reproductive technology programs.

* #### (2) State
  * In adopting the certification program, a State may not establish any regulation, standard, or requirement which has the effect of exercising supervision or control over the practice of medicine in assisted reproductive technology programs.

#### (j) Term
* The term of a certification issued by a State or an accreditation organization in a State shall be prescribed by the Secretary in the certification program and shall be valid for a period of time to be defined by the Secretary through the public comment process described in subsection (h)(2). The Secretary shall provide an application for recertification to be submitted at the time of changes in the ownership of a certified laboratory or changes in the administration of such a laboratory.

### §263a–3. Accreditation organizations
#### (a) Approval of accreditation organizations
* Not later than 2 years after October 24, 1992, the Secretary, through the Centers for Disease Control, shall promulgate criteria and procedures for the approval of accreditation organizations to inspect and certify embryo laboratories. The procedures shall require an application to the Secretary by an accreditation organization for approval. An accreditation organization which has received such an approval—

  * (1) may be used by States in the certification program under section 263a–2 of this title to inspect and certify embryo laboratories, or

  * (2) may certify embryo laboratories in States which have not adopted such a certification program.

#### (c) Evaluations
* The Secretary shall evaluate annually the performance of each accreditation organization approved by the Secretary by—

  * (1) inspecting under section 263a–2(i) of this title a sufficient number of embryo laboratories accredited by such an organization to allow a reasonable estimate of the performance of such organization, and

  * (2) such other means as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

#### (d) Transition
* If the Secretary revokes approval under section 263a–2(i)(3)(D) of this title of an accreditation organization after an evaluation under subsection (c), the certification of any embryo laboratory accredited by the organization shall continue in effect for 60 days after the laboratory is notified by the Secretary of the withdrawal of approval, except that the Secretary may extend the period during which the certification shall remain in effect if the Secretary determines that the laboratory submitted an application to another approved accreditation organization for certification after receipt of such notice in a timely manner.

### §263a–4. Certification revocation and suspension
#### (a) In general
* A certification issued by a State or an accreditation organization for an embryo laboratory shall be revoked or suspended if the State or organization finds, on the basis of inspections and after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the owner or operator of the laboratory, that the owner or operator or any employee of the laboratory—

  * (1) has been guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining the certification,

  * (2) has failed to comply with any standards under section 263a–2 of this title applicable to the certification, or

  * (3) has refused a request of the State or accreditation organization for permission to inspect the laboratory, its operations, and records.

#### (b) Effect
* If the certification of an embryo laboratory is revoked or suspended, the certification of the laboratory shall continue in effect for 60 days after the laboratory receives notice of the revocation or suspension. If the certification of an embryo laboratory is revoked or suspended, the laboratory may apply for recertification after one year after the date of the revocation or suspension.
