### PART I—C.W. BILL YOUNG CELL TRANSPLANTATION PROGRAM

### §274k. National Program
#### (a) Establishment
* The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall by one or more contracts establish and maintain a C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program (referred to in this section as the "Program"), successor to the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry, that has the purpose of increasing the number of transplants for recipients suitably matched to biologically unrelated donors of bone marrow and cord blood, and that meets the requirements of this section. The Secretary may award a separate contract to perform each of the major functions of the Program described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (d) if deemed necessary by the Secretary to operate an effective and efficient system that is in the best interest of patients. The Secretary shall conduct a separate competition for the initial establishment of the cord blood functions of the Program. The Program shall be under the general supervision of the Secretary. The Secretary shall establish an Advisory Council to advise, assist, consult with, and make recommendations to the Secretary on matters related to the activities carried out by the Program. The members of the Advisory Council shall be appointed in accordance with the following:

  * (1) Each member of the Advisory Council shall serve for a term of 2 years, and each such member may serve as many as 3 consecutive 2-year terms, except that—

    * (A) such limitations shall not apply to the Chair of the Advisory Council (or the Chair-elect) or to the member of the Advisory Council who most recently served as the Chair; and

    * (B) one additional consecutive 2-year term may be served by any member of the Advisory Council who has no employment, governance, or financial affiliation with any donor center, recruitment organization, transplant center, or cord blood bank.


  * (2) A member of the Advisory Council may continue to serve after the expiration of the term of such member until a successor is appointed.
