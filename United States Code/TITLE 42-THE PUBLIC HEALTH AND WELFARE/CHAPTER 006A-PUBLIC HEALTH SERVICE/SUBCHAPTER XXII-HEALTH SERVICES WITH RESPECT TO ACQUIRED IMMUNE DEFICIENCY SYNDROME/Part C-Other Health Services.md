### §300dd–32. Requirement of provision of certain counseling services
#### (a) Counseling before testing
* The Secretary may not make a grant under section 300dd–31 of this title to a State unless the State agrees that, before testing an individual pursuant to such section, the State will provide to the individual appropriate counseling with respect to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (based on the most recent scientific data relating to such syndrome), including—

#### (b) Counseling of individuals with negative test results
* The Secretary may not make a grant under section 300dd–31 of this title to a State unless the State agrees that, if the results of testing conducted pursuant to such section indicate that an individual is not infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the State will review for the individual the information provided pursuant to subsection (a) with respect to such syndrome, including—

  * (1) the information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of such subsection; and

#### (c) Counseling of individuals with positive test results
* The Secretary may not make a grant under section 300dd–31 of this title to a State unless the State agrees that, if the results of testing conducted pursuant to such section indicate that an individual is infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the State will provide to the individual appropriate counseling with respect to such syndrome, including—

#### (d) Rule of construction with respect to counseling without testing
* Agreements entered into pursuant to subsections (a) through (c) may not be construed to prohibit any grantee under section 300dd–31 of this title from expending the grant for the purpose of providing counseling services described in such subsections to an individual who will not undergo testing described in such section as a result of the grantee or the individual determining that such testing of the individual is not appropriate.

* (3) None of the fund appropriated to carry out this subpart may be used to provide counseling that is designed to promote or encourage, directly, homosexual or heterosexual sexual activity or intravenous drug abuse.

* (4) Paragraph (3) may not be construed to prohibit a counselor who has already performed the counseling of an individual required by paragraph (2), to provide accurate information about means to reduce an individual's risk of exposure to, or the transmission of, the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, provided that any informational materials used are not obscene.
