### SUBPART B—ADDITIONAL REMEDIES

### §300aa–21. Authority to bring actions
#### (a) Election
* After judgment has been entered by the United States Court of Federal Claims or, if an appeal is taken under section 300aa–12(f) of this title, after the appellate court's mandate is issued, the petitioner who filed the petition under section 300aa–11 of this title shall file with the clerk of the United States Court of Federal Claims—

  * (1) if the judgment awarded compensation, an election in writing to receive the compensation or to file a civil action for damages for such injury or death, or

  * (2) if the judgment did not award compensation, an election in writing to accept the judgment or to file a civil action for damages for such injury or death.


* An election shall be filed under this subsection not later than 90 days after the date of the court's final judgment with respect to which the election is to be made. If a person required to file an election with the court under this subsection does not file the election within the time prescribed for filing the election, such person shall be deemed to have filed an election to accept the judgment of the court. If a person elects to receive compensation under a judgment of the court in an action for a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine before October 1, 1988, or is deemed to have accepted the judgment of the court in such an action, such person may not bring or maintain a civil action for damages against a vaccine administrator or manufacturer for the vaccine-related injury or death for which the judgment was entered. For limitations on the bringing of civil actions for vaccine-related injuries or deaths associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, see section 300aa–11(a)(2) of this title.

#### (b) Continuance or withdrawal of petition
* A petitioner under a petition filed under section 300aa–11 of this title may submit to the United States Court of Federal Claims a notice in writing choosing to continue or to withdraw the petition if—

  * (1) a special master fails to make a decision on such petition within the 240 days prescribed by section 300aa–12(d)(3)(A)(ii) of this title (excluding (i) any period of suspension under section 300aa–12(d)(3)(C) or 300aa–12(d)(3)(D) of this title, and (ii) any days the petition is before a special master as a result of a remand under section 300aa–12(e)(2)(C) of this title), or

  * (2) the court fails to enter a judgment under section 300aa–12 of this title on the petition within 420 days (excluding (i) any period of suspension under section 300aa–12(d)(3)(C) or 300aa–12(d)(3)(D) of this title, and (ii) any days the petition is before a special master as a result of a remand under section 300aa–12(e)(2)(C) of this title) after the date on which the petition was filed.


* Such a notice shall be filed within 30 days of the provision of the notice required by section 300aa–12(g) of this title.

#### (c) Limitations of actions
* A civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death for which a petition was filed under section 300aa–11 of this title shall, except as provided in section 300aa–16(c) of this title, be brought within the period prescribed by limitations of actions under State law applicable to such civil action.

### §300aa–22. Standards of responsibility
#### (a) General rule
* Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (e) State law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death.

#### (b) Unavoidable adverse side effects; warnings
* (1) No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.

* (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a vaccine shall be presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and warnings if the vaccine manufacturer shows that it complied in all material respects with all requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and section 262 of this title (including regulations issued under such provisions) applicable to the vaccine and related to vaccine-related injury or death for which the civil action was brought unless the plaintiff shows—

  * (A) that the manufacturer engaged in the conduct set forth in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 300aa–23(d)(2) of this title, or

  * (B) by clear and convincing evidence that the manufacturer failed to exercise due care notwithstanding its compliance with such Act and section (and regulations issued under such provisions).

#### (c) Direct warnings
* No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, solely due to the manufacturer's failure to provide direct warnings to the injured party (or the injured party's legal representative) of the potential dangers resulting from the administration of the vaccine manufactured by the manufacturer.

#### (d) Construction
* The standards of responsibility prescribed by this section are not to be construed as authorizing a person who brought a civil action for damages against a vaccine manufacturer for a vaccine-related injury or death in which damages were denied or which was dismissed with prejudice to bring a new civil action against such manufacturer for such injury or death.

#### (e) Preemption
* No State may establish or enforce a law which prohibits an individual from bringing a civil action against a vaccine manufacturer for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death if such civil action is not barred by this part.

#### (b) Liability
* The first stage of such a civil action shall be held to determine if a vaccine manufacturer is liable under section 300aa–22 of this title.

#### (c) General damages
* The second stage of such a civil action shall be held to determine the amount of damages (other than punitive damages) a vaccine manufacturer found to be liable under section 300aa–22 of this title shall be required to pay.

#### (d) Punitive damages
* (1) If sought by the plaintiff, the third stage of such an action shall be held to determine the amount of punitive damages a vaccine manufacturer found to be liable under section 300aa–22 of this title shall be required to pay.

* (2) If in such an action the manufacturer shows that it complied, in all material respects, with all requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and this chapter applicable to the vaccine and related to the vaccine injury or death with respect to which the action was brought, the manufacturer shall not be held liable for punitive damages unless the manufacturer engaged in—

  * (A) fraud or intentional and wrongful withholding of information from the Secretary during any phase of a proceeding for approval of the vaccine under section 262 of this title,

  * (B) intentional and wrongful withholding of information relating to the safety or efficacy of the vaccine after its approval, or

  * (C) other criminal or illegal activity relating to the safety and effectiveness of vaccines,


* which activity related to the vaccine-related injury or death for which the civil action was brought.

#### (e) Evidence
* In any stage of a civil action, the Vaccine Injury Table, any finding of fact or conclusion of law of the United States Court of Federal Claims or a special master in a proceeding on a petition filed under section 300aa–11 of this title and the final judgment of the United States Court of Federal Claims and subsequent appellate review on such a petition shall not be admissible.
