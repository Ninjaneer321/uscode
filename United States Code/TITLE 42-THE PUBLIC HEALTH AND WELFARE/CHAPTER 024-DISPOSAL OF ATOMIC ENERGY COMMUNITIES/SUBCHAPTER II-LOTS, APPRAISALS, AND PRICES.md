### SUBCHAPTER II—LOTS, APPRAISALS, AND PRICES

### §2321. Lots; establishment of boundaries
* The Commission is authorized to plat each community immediately upon passage of this chapter, or immediately upon the inclusion of the community within the provisions of this chapter. The Commission may establish lot boundaries, and realine, divide, or enlarge existing tracts as it deems appropriate.

### §2322. Appraisal of property
* The Commission shall proceed to secure appraisals of all property at the community which is to be sold pursuant to this chapter. The appraisals shall be made by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his designee. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be reimbursed from the Community Disposal Operations Fund for the cost of such appraisals. Appraisals made under this section shall be the appraisals on which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may insure any mortgage or loan under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] until such time as he finds that the appraisal values generally in the community no longer represent the fair market values of the properties.

### §2323. Basis of appraisal
* Except for lots sold pursuant to the provisions of section 2347(a) of this title, the appraised value shall be the current fair market value of the Government's interest in the property.

### §2324. Posting of lists showing appraised value
* Lists showing the appraised value of each parcel of property to be offered for sale to priority purchasers shall, prior to the offering of such property for sale, be made available for public inspection, at reasonable times, at the offices of the Commission at the community.

### §2325. Sales price
#### (a) Government-owned single or duplex houses
* In the sale to priority purchasers of properties on which are located Government-owned single or duplex houses, the sales price shall be the appraised value less a deduction of 15 per centum of the appraised value and less the deductions provided by section 2326 of this title.

#### (b) Other properties
* In all other cases the sales price to priority purchasers shall be the appraised value less the deductions provided by section 2326 of this title, except that sales made under sections 2343(b) and 2343(c) of this title shall be made at the prices set forth therein.

#### (c) Appraised value of interest in commercial property
* The appraised value of the Government's interest in commercial property shall, in the cases where renegotiation of the lease is requested by the lessee under the provisions of section 2201(e) of this title be based upon the renegotiated lease if any is agreed on. Where such renegotiations are requested, the sales proceedings shall not be initiated until the completion of the renegotiation.

### §2326. Deductions from sales price
#### (a) Improvements
* In addition to any other deduction which may be permitted from the sales price for property, there shall, upon application by the prospective purchaser, be deducted the amount by which the current fair market value of the Government's interest in the premises is enhanced as a result of improvements to the premises made by, or at the expense of, the prospective purchaser: _Provided_, That, with reference to commercial property, the improvement credit allowed shall be the value of the enhancement of the Government's interest in the property, as determined by the Commission on the basis of the appraisal provided for under section 2322 of this title: _Provided further_, That such credit shall be reduced to the extent that lessee has been previously compensated therefor, as determined by the Commission, under the terms of the lease or otherwise.

#### (b) Improvements by occupant of single family or duplex house
* An occupant of a single family or duplex house shall, upon application therefor, be entitled to a credit, against the purchase price of any residential property purchased through the exercise of a priority right established under the provisions of section 2332 of this title, for the amount by which the current fair market value of the Government's interest in the single family or duplex house of which he was an occupant is enhanced as a result of improvements to the premises of such single family or duplex house made by, or at the expense of, such occupant.

#### (c) Determination of value of improvements
* The value of the improvements as specified in subsections (a) and (b) shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 2322 of this title.

#### (d) Additional deduction to persons purchasing property without benefit of indemnity provisions
* Persons purchasing property pursuant to the provisions of section 2342 of this title, who do not desire to avail themselves of the indemnity provisions contained in sections 2363 to 2366 of this title, shall be entitled to an additional deduction of 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property in addition to any other deduction set forth in this section.
