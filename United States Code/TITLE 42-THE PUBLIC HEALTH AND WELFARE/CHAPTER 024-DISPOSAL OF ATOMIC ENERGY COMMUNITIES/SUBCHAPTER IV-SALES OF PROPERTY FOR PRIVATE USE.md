### SUBCHAPTER IV—SALES OF PROPERTY FOR PRIVATE USE

### §2341. Applicability of subchapter
* The provisions of this subchapter shall be made applicable at each community as soon as the Commission makes a finding in writing that there is a reasonable possibility that the Government-owned real property at such community can be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.

### §2342. Disposal of property
#### (a) Property under lease or license agreement
* The Commission shall offer for disposal all real property (including such improvements thereon and such fixtures, equipment, and other personal property incident thereto as it may deem appropriate) within the community which is presently under lease or license agreement with the Commission or its community management contractor for residential, commercial or industrial, agricultural, church or other nonprofit use, or which, in the opinion of the Commission, is appropriate for such use, other than—

  * (1) structures which in the opinion of the Commission should be removed from the community because of their unsatisfactory type of construction, condition, or location; or

  * (2) property which in the opinion of the Commission should be transferred pursuant to subchapters VI or VII; or

  * (3) property which in the opinion of the Commission should be retained by the Commission for its own use.

#### (b) Discretionary disposal of other real property
* The Commission may, but shall not be required to, dispose of any other real property at the community, whether within or outside of that community.

#### (c) Terms and conditions; impairment of rights
* Such property shall be disposed of on such terms and conditions, consistent with this subchapter, as the Commission shall prescribe in the national interest, and without regard to any preferences or priorities whatever except those provided for pursuant to this chapter. Transfers by the Commission of such property shall not impair rights under existing leases and covenants, including any purchase rights therein conferred.

### §2343. Sales
#### (a) Notice to priority holders
* Where rights of priority have been granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter to Government-owned property, it shall be offered for sale to priority purchaser by giving notice to those eligible for such priority. Such notice shall (1) be in such manner as the Commission shall prescribe, (2) identify the property to be sold, and (3) state the terms and conditions of sale and the date of the offer which, in the case of occupants of single family or duplex houses, shall expire not less than ninety days after the date of the offer.

#### (b) Sale of property to highest bidder
* Any property (other than church property) classified for sale under section 2331 of this title and offered for sale under section 2342 of this title, as to which no priority right has been conferred, or as to which all priority rights have expired, shall be advertised for sale to the highest bidder, subject to the right of the Commission to reject any or all bids. No bid shall be accepted which is below the appraised value or, in the case of Government-owned single and duplex houses is below 85 per centum of the appraised value.

#### (c) Disposal of property not sold at auction
* As to any property which has not been sold under subsection (b) within ninety days after the first advertisement for sale under such subsection the Commission may make such disposition, on such terms and conditions, as it may deem appropriate.

#### (d) Church property
* Property for use of churches, in respect of which all priority rights have expired, may be disposed of by advertising and competitive bid, or by negotiated sale or other transfer at such prices, terms, and conditions as the Commission shall determine to be fair and equitable.

### §2344. Cash sales
* All sales shall be for cash, and the buyer shall arrange for the necessary financing, except as provided in subchapter V of this chapter.

### §2345. Deeds; form and provisions
* Deeds executed in connection with the disposal of property pursuant to the provisions of this chapter—

  * (a) shall be as simple as the Commission shall find to be appropriate, and may contain such warranties or covenants of title and other provisions (including any indemnity) as the Commission may deem appropriate;

  * (b) with respect to any dormitories or apartment houses and any property used or to be used for construction of housing developments for rental purposes, may retain or acquire such rights to the Commission to designate the future occupants of part or all of such properties as it may deem appropriate to insure the availability of housing for employees of the Commission and its contractors;

  * (c) may require that the transferee, his heirs, successors, and assigns shall compensate the Commission for any municipal services provided by the Commission at rates which will not be in excess of the average tax for such services in the immediate vicinity of the community; and any amounts due and unpaid for such compensation (together with interest and costs thereon) shall, as of the date on which such amounts become delinquent, be a lien in favor of the United States upon the premises sold by the Commission, though not valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed in accordance with the laws of the State in which the property is situated or in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which the property subject to the lien is situated, if such State has not by law provided for the filing of such notice;

  * (d) in transferring any property pursuant to sections 2321 and 2342 of this title, may impose such restrictions and requirements relating to the use of the premises and to public health and safety, as the Commission may deem appropriate, which restrictions and requirements shall not be valid beyond one year after the incorporation of the city at the community or after June 30, 1966, in the case of Los Alamos; and

  * (e) may require that any payments in lieu of property taxes or assessments for local improvements made by the Commission with respect to the property shall be equitably prorated.

### §2346. Occupancy by existing tenants
* Upon application by any occupant of a single or duplex house made within the period of the first priority when such house is first offered for sale under this chapter, the Commission shall execute a lease to such occupant for a period not to exceed one year from the date on which such property is first offered for sale, or for such period as he remains a project-connected person, whichever is shorter. In selling any house with respect to which a lease executed under this section is in effect, the Commission may provide that the purchaser shall assume any or all obligations of the lessor, but the Commission shall guarantee the lessee's performance under the terms of the lease.

### §2347. Sale of lots to lessees or individual owners
* (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Commission is authorized, immediately upon passage of this chapter, or immediately upon the inclusion of the community within the provisions of this chapter, to offer for sale to the lessees single residential lots, which were leased by competitive bid and which do not have a Government-owned building thereon, at a price equal to the initial valuation of the lot as stated in the lease.

* (b) The Commission is authorized to offer for sale, as soon as possible, other lots, to individual owners, upon which single family or duplex houses may be erected, taking into consideration the zoning restrictions the new city is likely to enact with respect to those lots. The zoning restrictions to be taken into account at Los Alamos shall be those which the local government is likely to enact with respect to those lots.

### §2348. Priority sale of apartment houses
#### (a) Grantees eligible; priorities; applicability of deduction, financing and indemnity provisions
* The Commission is authorized at Los Alamos to grant to occupants project-connected persons, and persons residing in the community both at the time of offering of an apartment house for sale and for the preceding six months, and to any of the foregoing persons acting together, such priority interests and priority rights for the purchase of the apartment house as the Commission determines to be fair and reasonable: _Provided_, That a first priority right to purchase may be granted only to an occupant or a group of occupants, or an assignee (whose membership or ownership is composed of occupants, or project-connected persons, or persons residing in the community both at the time of offering of an apartment house for sale and for the preceding six months, or any of the foregoing persons) of the priority interests of such occupants, who or which has obtained the priority interest of at least 60 per centum of the occupants of the apartment house: _Provided further_, That a second priority right to purchase may be granted only to an entity whose membership or ownership consists of occupants, or project-connected persons, or persons residing in the community both at the time of offering of an apartment house for sale and for the preceding six months, or any of the foregoing persons (provided that such entity has obtained the priority interest of at least one occupant), and whose membership or ownership equals in number, and occupies or agrees to occupy, at least 70 per centum of the housing units in the apartment house. The 15 per centum deduction specified by section 2325(a) of this title, the deduction provided by section 2326(d) of this title, the financing provisions of section 2362 of this title, and the indemnity provided by sections 2363 to 2366 of this title shall be applicable to such priority sales of apartment houses. Priority interests granted by the Commission under this section shall be transferable as the Commission may by rule or regulation prescribe, but no priority right to purchase shall be transferred except as provided by section 2333 of this title.

#### (b) Leasing arrangements by non-participants in apartment house sales; assumption of lessor's obligations
* Any occupant who does not participate in the purchase of an apartment house with respect to which a priority right to purchase has been granted shall be entitled, at the time of sale by the Commission, to a lease for occupancy of his housing unit for a period not to exceed fifteen months from the date the property was first offered for sale: _Provided_, That the occupant makes application for such a lease within 30 days of the grant of such priority to purchase. In selling any apartment house with respect to which lease executed under this section is in effect, the Commission is authorized to provide for the purchaser to assume any or all obligations of the lessor. The Commission in such event shall guarantee the lessee's performance of the lease.

#### (c) Eligibility to participate in priority purchase
* Persons who have purchased, either individually or jointly with other persons, a single-family house or duplex house (or a single-family unit in a duplex house) at Los Alamos pursuant to a priority right under this chapter shall not be eligible to participate in the priority purchase of an apartment house.

#### (d) Rules and regulations
* The Commission is authorized to prescribe by rule or regulation such other conditions as it may find necessary or desirable for qualification of priority interests and rights for the purchase of an apartment house.

### §2349. Hanford project; disposal of property
* In addition to any other authority the Commission may have, the Commission is authorized, without regard to the provisions of section 6101 of title 41, to lease land, and to sell, lease, including leases with options to purchase, and otherwise dispose of improvements thereon, and such equipment and other personal property as is determined to be directly related thereto, in the Commission's Hanford project in and near Richland, Washington, upon a determination by the Commission that such disposition will serve to prevent or reduce the adverse economic impact of actual or anticipated reductions in Commission programs in that area: _Provided, however_, That the compensation to the Government for any such disposition shall be the estimated fair market value or estimated fair rental value of the property as determined by the Commission: _Provided further_, That before the Commission makes any disposition of property under the authority of this section, the basis for the proposed disposition (with necessary background and explanatory data) shall be submitted to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, and a period of forty-five days shall elapse while Congress is in session (in computing such forty-five-days, there shall be excluded the days on which either House is not in session because of adjournment of more than three days): _Provided, however_, That those Committees, after having received the basis for the proposed disposition, may by resolution in writing waive the conditions of, or all or any portion of, such forty-five-day period.
