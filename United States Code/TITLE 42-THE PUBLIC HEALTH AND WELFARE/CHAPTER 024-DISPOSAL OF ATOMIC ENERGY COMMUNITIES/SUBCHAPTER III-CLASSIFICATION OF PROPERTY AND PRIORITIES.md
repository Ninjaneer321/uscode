### SUBCHAPTER III—CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY AND PRIORITIES

### §2331. Classification of property
#### (a) Property within each community
* Immediately upon passage of this chapter, or, in the case of Los Alamos, upon its inclusion within this chapter, the Commission shall classify all real property (including such improvements and such fixtures, equipment and other personal property incident thereto as it may deem appropriate) within each community in accordance with such classifications as shall insure reasonably similar treatment for reasonably similar property. The classification shall be made by such procedures, consistent with this subchapter, as it shall determine.

#### (b) Property at or in vicinity of each community
* The Commission may, but shall not be required to, classify any other real property at or in the vicinity of the community, whether within or outside of that community.

#### (c) Residential structures within each community
* Prior to the date any residential property is first offered for sale at Los Alamos, the Commission shall further classify each residential structure within the community of Los Alamos either as a single family house, a duplex house, an apartment house, a dormitory, or as a residential structure containing two or more separate single family units and shall post, at the offices of the Commission at Los Alamos, a list, available for public inspection at reasonable times, showing the classification of each such residential structure. For the purposes of this chapter, each such residential structure will thereafter be deemed to be a single family house, a duplex house, an apartment house, a dormitory, or a residential structure containing two or more separate single family units in accordance with its classification. In determining the classification of each such residential structure containing two or more single family units, the Commission shall consider (1) the practicability of selling separately the single family units, and (2) the insurability of mortgages under section 1715n(a) of title 12.

### §2332. Priorities; uniformity; preferences; impairment of rights
* The Commission shall establish, by rule or regulation, a detailed system of reasonable and fair priority rights applicable to the sale of Government-owned property to private purchasers at each community. The priorities shall—

  * (a) be uniform in each class or subclass of property;

  * (b) give such preference to occupants and project-connected persons and to incoming employees of the Commission, of a contractor, or of a licensee as the Commission finds necessary or desirable, giving due consideration to the following factors:

    * (1) The retention and recruitment of personnel essential to the atomic energy program;

    * (2) The minimization of dislocations within the community;

    * (3) The expeditious accomplishment of the disposal program; and

    * (4) The desirability of encouraging private firms to locate or remain in the community;


  * (c) give the occupant of a Government-owned single family house, and the senior occupant of a duplex house, at least ninety days in which to exercise the first right of priority;

  * (d) permit persons who have formerly been occupants, project-connected persons, or inhabitants of the community, upon application therefor, to have such priority as the Commission finds to be fair and equitable; and

  * (e) not impair any rights, including purchase rights, conferred by existing leases and covenants.

### §2333. Transfer of priorities
* No priority shall be transferable, except—

  * (a) a husband and wife may exercise a priority in their joint names;

  * (b) a religious organization may exercise the priority which would otherwise belong to its priest, minister, or rabbi, regardless of whether that position happens to be filled at the time of the exercise of the priority;

  * (c) two or more priority holders having a common interest in a building or location may assign their interests to a single assignee; and

  * (d) the Commission may permit such other transfers as it finds to be fair and equitable.
