### SUBCHAPTER V—FINANCING

### §2361. Contract to purchase by priority purchaser
* The Commission may, in the sale of any single-family or duplex house to a priority purchaser, enter into a contract to purchase which provides that the purchaser shall conclude his purchase within not more than three years after the date the contract is entered into. Such contracts to purchase shall provide for such periodic payments, including payments on account of principal, interest, or tax equivalents, as the Commission shall prescribe.

### §2362. Financing by Commission
#### (a) Acceptance of residential property notes
* In the event that the Commission finds that financing on reasonable terms is not available from other sources, the Commission may, in order to facilitate the sale of residential property under subchapter IV of this chapter, accept, in partial payment of the purchase price of any such property notes secured by first mortgages on such terms and conditions as the Commission shall deem appropriate. In the case of houses and apartment buildings, the maturity and percentage of appraised value in connection with such notes and mortgages shall not exceed those prescribed under section 1715n(a) of title 12, and the interest rate shall equal the interest rate plus the premium being charged (and any periodic service charge being authorized by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for properties of similar character) under section 1715n(a) of title 12, at the effective date of such notes and mortgages.

#### (b) Advances
* In connection with the sale of residential property financed under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission is authorized to make advances for necessary repairs, or for the rehabilitation, modernization, rebuilding or enlargement of single and duplex residential properties to priority purchasers, and to include such advances in the amount of the note secured by the mortgage on such property.

#### (c) Acceptance of commercial property notes
* In the event that the Commission finds that financing on reasonable terms is not available from other sources, the Commission may, in order to facilitate the sale of commercial property under subchapter IV of this chapter, accept, in partial payment of the purchase price of any commercial property notes secured by first mortgages on such terms and conditions as the Commission shall deem appropriate.

#### (d) Sale of notes and mortgages
* The Commission may sell any notes and mortgages acquired under subsections (a) and (c) of this section on terms set by the Commission. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law and without regard to the provisions of section 6101 of title 41, the Commission may, in accordance with such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, (1) enter into contracts for servicing any of the notes and mortgages it has acquired, and (2) sell or enter into contracts to sell to a servicer any notes and mortgages with respect to which a servicing contract has been entered into by the servicer with the Commission: _Provided_, That with respect to sales of notes and mortgages under (2) the Commission shall comply with section 6101 of title 41 unless it determines that such compliance would not be feasible.

### §2363. Indemnity obligation of Commission; incorporation by reference in deed
* For a period of not more than fifteen years after August 4, 1955, or, in the case of Los Alamos, not more than fifteen years after the date it is included within this chapter, the Commission shall indemnify the purchaser (except a purchaser taking advantage of the provisions of section 2326(d) of this title), and any successor in title, of any such single family or duplex house as set forth in this subchapter. This indemnity shall be deemed to be incorporated in the deeds given on the sale of Government-owned houses. One person may not invoke the indemnity in respect of more than one house.

### §2364. Community employment and population
* The indemnity obligation specified in section 2363 of this title shall arise only if, for the six months just preceding the date on which it is invoked—

  * (a) the total number of operating, maintenance, and administrative employees in the project area, as determined by the Commission, has been less than fourteen thousand three hundred and thirty-seven in the case of Oak Ridge or seven thousand six hundred and twenty-two in the case of Richland or four thousand six hundred and twenty in the case of Los Alamos; and

  * (b) the population in the community has been less than twenty-nine thousand two hundred and fifty in the case of Oak Ridge or twenty-five thousand two hundred in the case of Richland or eleven thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine in the case of Los Alamos.


* For purposes of this section employment shall be determined on the basis of the pay period or periods ending nearest the 15th of each month.

### §2365. Amount of indemnity
* The indemnity obligation of the Commission specified in section 2363 of this title shall be for such amount, less the sales price of the property, as would have remained unpaid under a loan entered into on the date of the execution of the original deed by the Commission—

  * (1) which was in the amount of the purchase price from the Commission and provided for equal monthly payments of principal and interest over a period of twenty years computed on the basis of the average interest and other charges recorded for property of the same class at the community; and

  * (2) on which all payments due to the date when notice was received by the Commission had been made.

### §2366. Conditions of indemnity; purchase of property by Commission
* The Commission shall make the indemnity payment specified by section 2365 of this title only if the Commission receives a notice from the then owner of the property that he is about to sell the property for a sum less than the unpaid balance of the real or hypothetical loan calculated pursuant to such section. Such payment shall be made only if—

  * (a) notice is given to the Commission at a time when the conditions of section 2364 of this title are satisfied;

  * (b) the sale is made within such time as the Commission may prescribe and in a manner which the Commission determined to afford adequate assurance of a fair price without excessive costs; and

  * (c) the Commission is given such prior notice of the sale and such opportunity to become a purchaser as it shall prescribe.


* In such circumstances the Commission is authorized to purchase the property. Sales pursuant to this section and payment by the Commission of such amount, if any, as is owing pursuant to sections 2363 to 2366 of this title shall end the obligation of the Commission under sections 2363 to 2366 of this title with respect to that property.
