### §7191. Procedures for issuance of rules, regulations, or orders
#### (a) Applicability of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title&nbsp;5
* (1) Subject to the other requirements of this subchapter, the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 shall apply in accordance with its terms to any rule or regulation, or any order having the applicability and effect of a rule (as defined in section 551(4) of title 5), issued pursuant to authority vested by law in, or transferred or delegated to, the Secretary, or required by this chapter or any other Act to be carried out by any other officer, employee, or component of the Department, other than the Commission, including any such rule, regulation, or order of a State, or local government agency or officer thereof, issued pursuant to authority delegated by the Secretary in accordance with this subchapter. If any provision of any Act, the functions of which are transferred, vested, or delegated pursuant to this chapter, provides administrative procedure requirements in addition to the requirements provided in this subchapter, such additional requirements shall also apply to actions under that provision.

* (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this subchapter shall apply to the Commission to the same extent this subchapter applies to the Secretary in the exercise of any of the Commission's functions under section 7172(c)(1) of this title or which the Secretary has assigned under section 7172(e) of this title.

#### (b) Substantial issue of fact or law or likelihood of substantial impact on Nation's economy, etc.; oral presentation
* (1) If the Secretary determines, on his own initiative or in response to any showing made pursuant to paragraph (2) (with respect to a proposed rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a)) that no substantial issue of fact or law exists and that such rule, regulation, or order is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses, such proposed rule, regulation, or order may be promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title 5. If the Secretary determines that a substantial issue of fact or law exists or that such rule, regulation, or order is likely to have a substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses, an opportunity for oral presentation of views, data, and arguments shall be provided.

* (2) Any person, who would be adversely affected by the implementation of any proposed rule, regulation, or order who desires an opportunity for oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, may submit material supporting the existence of such substantial issues or such impact.

* (3) A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation with respect to a rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a).

#### (c) Waiver of requirements
* The requirements of subsection (b) of this section may be waived where strict compliance is found by the Secretary to be likely to cause serious harm or injury to the public health, safety, or welfare, and such finding is set out in detail in such rule, regulation, or order. In the event the requirements of this section are waived, the requirements shall be satisfied within a reasonable period of time subsequent to the promulgation of such rule, regulation, or order.

#### (d) Effects confined to single unit of local government, geographic area within State, or State; hearing or oral presentation
* (1) With respect to any rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a), the effects of which, except for indirect effects of an inconsequential nature, are confined to—

  * (A) a single unit of local government or the residents thereof;

  * (B) a single geographic area within a State or the residents thereof; or

  * (C) a single State or the residents thereof;


* the Secretary shall, in any case where appropriate, afford an opportunity for a hearing or the oral presentation of views, and provide procedures for the holding of such hearing or oral presentation within the boundaries of the unit of local government, geographic area, or State described in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph as the case may be.

* (2) For the purposes of this subsection—

  * (A) the term "unit of local government" means a county, municipality, town, township, village, or other unit of general government below the State level; and

  * (B) the term "geographic area within a State" means a special purpose district or other region recognized for governmental purposes within such State which is not a unit of local government.


* (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a hearing or an oral presentation of views where none is required by this section or other provision of law.

#### (e) Prescription of procedures for State and local government agencies
* Where authorized by any law vested, transferred, or delegated pursuant to this chapter, the Secretary may, by rule, prescribe procedures for State or local government agencies authorized by the Secretary to carry out such functions as may be permitted under applicable law. Such procedures shall apply to such agencies in lieu of this section, and shall require that prior to taking any action, such agencies shall take steps reasonably calculated to provide notice to persons who may be affected by the action, and shall afford an opportunity for presentation of views (including oral presentation of views where practicable) within a reasonable time before taking the action.

### §7192. Judicial review
#### (a) Agency action
* Judicial review of agency action taken under any law the functions of which are vested by law in, or transferred or delegated to the Secretary, the Commission or any officer, employee, or component of the Department shall, notwithstanding such vesting, transfer, or delegation, be made in the manner specified in or for such law.

#### (b) Review by district court of United States; removal
* Notwithstanding the amount in controversy, the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of all other cases or controversies arising exclusively under this chapter, or under rules, regulations, or orders issued exclusively thereunder, other than any actions taken to implement or enforce any rule, regulation, or order by any officer of a State or local government agency under this chapter, except that nothing in this section affects the power of any court of competent jurisdiction to consider, hear, and determine in any proceeding before it any issue raised by way of defense (other than a defense based on the unconstitutionality of this chapter or the validity of action taken by any agency under this chapter). If in any such proceeding an issue by way of defense is raised based on the unconstitutionality of this chapter or the validity of agency action under this chapter, the case shall be subject to removal by either party to a district court of the United States in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 89 of title 28. Cases or controversies arising under any rule, regulation, or order of any officer of a State or local government agency may be heard in either (A) any appropriate State court, or (B) without regard to the amount in controversy, the district courts of the United States.

#### (c) Litigation supervision by Attorney General
* Subject to the provisions of section 7171(i) of this title and notwithstanding any other law, the litigation of the Department shall be subject to the supervision of the Attorney General pursuant to chapter 31 of title 28. The Attorney General may authorize any attorney of the Department to conduct any civil litigation of the Department in any Federal court except the Supreme Court.

Each remedial order shall be in writing and shall describe with particularity the nature of the violation, including a reference to the provision of such rule, regulation, or order alleged to have been violated. For purposes of this section "person" includes any individual, association, company, corporation, partnership, or other entity however organized.

#### (b) Notice of intent to contest; final order not subject to review
* If within thirty days after the receipt of the remedial order issued by the Secretary, the person fails to notify the Secretary that he intends to contest the remedial order, the remedial order shall become effective and shall be deemed a final order of the Secretary and not subject to review by any court or agency.

#### (c) Notice of contestation to Commission; stay; hearing; cross examination; final order; enforcement and review
* If within thirty days after the receipt of the remedial order issued by the Secretary, the person notifies the Secretary that he intends to contest a remedial order issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall immediately advise the Commission of such notification. Upon such notice, the Commission shall stay the effect of the remedial order, unless the Commission finds the public interest requires immediate compliance with such remedial order. The Commission shall, upon request, afford an opportunity for a hearing, including, at a minimum, the submission of briefs, oral or documentary evidence, and oral arguments. To the extent that the Commission in its discretion determines that such is required for a full and true disclosure of the facts, the Commission shall afford the right of cross examination. The Commission shall thereafter issue an order, based on findings of fact, affirming, modifying, or vacating the Secretary's remedial order, or directing other appropriate relief, and such order shall, for the purpose of judicial review, constitute a final agency action, except that enforcement and other judicial review of such action shall be the responsibility of the Secretary.

#### (d) Time limits
* The Secretary may set reasonable time limits for the Commission to complete action on a proceeding referred to it pursuant to this section.

#### (e) Effect on procedural action taken by Secretary prior to issuance of initial remedial order
* Nothing in preceding provisions of this section shall be construed to affect any procedural action taken by the Secretary prior to or incident to initial issuance of a remedial order which is the subject of the hearing provided in preceding provisions of this section, but such procedures shall be reviewable in the hearing.

#### (f) Savings provision
* The provisions of preceding provisions of this section shall be applicable only with respect to proceedings initiated by a notice of probable violation issued after October 1, 1977.

#### (g) Retroactive application; marketing of petroleum products
* With respect to any person whose sole petroleum industry operation relates to the marketing of petroleum products, the Secretary or any person acting on his behalf may not exercise discretion to maintain a civil action (other than an action for injunctive relief) or issue a remedial order against such person for any violation of any rule or regulation if—

  * (1) such civil action or order is based on a retroactive application of such rule or regulation or is based upon a retroactive interpretation of such rule or regulation; and

  * (2) such person relied in good faith upon rules, regulations, or ruling in effect on the date of the violation interpreting such rules or regulations.

### §7194. Requests for adjustments
* (a) The Secretary or any officer designated by him shall provide for the making of such adjustments to any rule, regulation or order described in section 7191(a) of this title issued under the Federal Energy Administration Act [15 U.S.C. 761 et seq.], the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 [15 U.S.C. 751 et seq.], the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 [15 U.S.C. 791 et seq.], or the Energy Policy and Conservation Act [42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.], consistent with the other purposes of the relevant Act, as may be necessary to prevent special hardship, inequity, or unfair distribution of burdens, and shall by rule, establish procedures which are available to any person for the purpose of seeking an interpretation, modification, or recission of, exception to, or exemption from, such rule, regulation or order. The Secretary or any such officer shall additionally insure that each decision on any application or petition requesting an adjustment shall specify the standards of hardship, inequity, or unfair distribution of burden by which any disposition was made, and the specific application of such standards to the facts contained in any such application or petition.

* (b)(1) If any person is aggrieved or adversely affected by a denial of a request for adjustment under subsection (a) such person may request a review of such denial by the Commission and may obtain judicial review in accordance with this subchapter when such a denial becomes final.

* (2) The Commission shall, by rule, establish appropriate procedures, including a hearing when requested, for review of a denial. Action by the Commission under this section shall be considered final agency action within the meaning of section 704 of title 5 and shall not be subject to further review by the Secretary or any officer or employee of the Department. Litigation involving judicial review of such action shall be the responsibility of the Secretary.

### §7195. Report to Congress; contents
* Within one year after October 1, 1977, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress concerning the actions taken to implement section 7191 of this title. The report shall include a discussion of the adequacy of such section from the standpoint of the Department and the public, including a summary of any comments obtained by the Secretary from the public about such section and implementing regulations, and such recommendations as the Secretary deems appropriate concerning the procedures required by such section.
