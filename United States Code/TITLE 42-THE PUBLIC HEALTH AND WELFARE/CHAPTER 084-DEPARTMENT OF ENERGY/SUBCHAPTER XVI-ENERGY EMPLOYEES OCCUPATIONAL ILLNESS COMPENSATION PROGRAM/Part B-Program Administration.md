### §7384p. Responsibilities of Secretary of Health and Human Services
* The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall carry out that Secretary's responsibilities with respect to the compensation program with the assistance of the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

### §7384q. Designation of additional members of special exposure cohort
#### (a) Advice on additional members
* (1) The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health under section 7384o of this title shall advise the President whether there is a class of employees at any Department of Energy facility who likely were exposed to radiation at that facility but for whom it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose they received.

* (2) The advice of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health under paragraph (1) shall be based on exposure assessments by radiation health professionals, information provided by the Department of Energy, and such other information as the Advisory Board considers appropriate.

* (3) The President shall request advice under paragraph (1) after consideration of petitions by classes of employees described in that paragraph for such advice. The President shall consider such petitions pursuant to procedures established by the President.

#### (b) Designation of additional members
* Subject to the provisions of section 7384l(14)(C) of this title, the members of a class of employees at a Department of Energy facility, or at an atomic weapons employer facility, may be treated as members of the Special Exposure Cohort for purposes of the compensation program if the President, upon recommendation of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, determines that—

  * (1) it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose that the class received; and

  * (2) there is a reasonable likelihood that such radiation dose may have endangered the health of members of the class.

#### (c) Deadlines
* (1) Not later than 180 days after the date on which the President receives a petition for designation as members of the Special Exposure Cohort, the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health shall submit to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health a recommendation on that petition, including all supporting documentation.

* (2)(A) Upon receipt by the President of a recommendation of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health that the President should determine in the affirmative that paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) apply to a class, the President shall have a period of 30 days in which to determine whether such paragraphs apply to the class and to submit that determination (whether affirmative or negative) to Congress.

* (C) If the President does not submit a determination required by subparagraph (A) within the period required by subparagraph (A), then upon the day following the expiration of that period, it shall be deemed for purposes of section 7384l(14)(C)(ii) of this title that the President submitted the report under that provision on that day.

#### (d) Access to information
* The Secretary of Energy shall provide, in accordance with law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the members and staff of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health access to relevant information on worker exposures, including access to Restricted Data (as defined in section 2014(y) of this title.

### §7384r. Separate treatment of chronic silicosis
#### (a) Sense of Congress
* Congress finds that employees who worked in Department of Energy test sites and later contracted chronic silicosis should also be considered for inclusion in the compensation program. Recognizing that chronic silicosis resulting from exposure to silica is not a condition unique to the nuclear weapons industry, it is not the intent of Congress with this subchapter to establish a precedent on the question of chronic silicosis as a compensable occupational disease. Consequently, it is the sense of Congress that a further determination by the President is appropriate before these workers are included in the compensation program.

#### (b) Certification by President
* A covered employee with chronic silicosis shall be treated as a covered employee (as defined in section 7384l(1) of this title) for the purposes of the compensation program required by section 7384d of this title unless the President submits to Congress not later than 180 days after October 30, 2000, the certification of the President that there is insufficient basis to include such employees. The President shall submit with the certification any recommendations about the compensation program with respect to covered employees with chronic silicosis as the President considers appropriate.

#### (c) Exposure to silica in the performance of duty
* A covered employee shall, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, be determined to have been exposed to silica in the performance of duty for the purposes of the compensation program if, and only if, the employee was present for a number of work days aggregating at least 250 work days during the mining of tunnels at a Department of Energy facility located in Nevada or Alaska for tests or experiments related to an atomic weapon.

#### (d) Covered employee with chronic silicosis
* For purposes of this subchapter, the term "covered employee with chronic silicosis" means a Department of Energy employee, or a Department of Energy contractor employee, with chronic silicosis who was exposed to silica in the performance of duty as determined under subsection (c).

#### (e) Chronic silicosis
* For purposes of this subchapter, the term "chronic silicosis" means a nonmalignant lung disease if—

  * (1) the initial occupational exposure to silica dust preceded the onset of silicosis by at least 10 years; and

  * (2) a written diagnosis of silicosis is made by a medical doctor and is accompanied by—

    * (A) a chest radiograph, interpreted by an individual certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as a B reader, classifying the existence of pneumoconioses of category 1/0 or higher;

    * (B) results from a computer assisted tomograph or other imaging technique that are consistent with silicosis; or

    * (C) lung biopsy findings consistent with silicosis.

### §7384s. Compensation and benefits to be provided
#### (a) Compensation provided
* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a covered employee, or the survivor of that covered employee if the employee is deceased, shall receive compensation for the disability or death of that employee from that employee's occupational illness in the amount of $150,000.
