### SUBCHAPTER I—LABORATORY MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

### §18611. Sense of Congress on accelerating energy innovation
* It is the sense of Congress that—

  * (1) although important progress has been made in cost reduction and deployment of clean energy technologies, accelerating clean energy innovation will help meet critical competitiveness, energy security, and environmental goals;

  * (2) accelerating the pace of clean energy innovation in the United States calls for—

    * (A) supporting existing research and development programs at the Department and the world-class National Laboratories;

    * (B) exploring and developing new pathways for innovators, investors, and decision-makers to leverage the resources of the Department for addressing the challenges and comparative strengths of geographic regions; and

    * (C) recognizing the financial constraints of the Department, regularly reviewing clean energy programs to ensure that taxpayer investments are maximized;


  * (3) the energy supply, demand, policies, markets, and resource options of the United States vary by geographic region;

  * (4) a regional approach to innovation can bridge the gaps between local talent, institutions, and industries to identify opportunities and convert United States investment into domestic companies; and

  * (5) Congress, the Secretary, and energy industry participants should advance efforts that promote international, domestic, and regional cooperation on the research and development of energy innovations that—

    * (A) provide clean, affordable, and reliable energy for everyone;

    * (B) promote economic growth;

    * (C) are critical for energy security; and

    * (D) are sustainable without government support.

### §18613. Research grants database
#### (a) In general
* The Secretary shall establish and maintain a public database, accessible on the website of the Department, that contains a searchable listing of each unclassified research and development project contract, grant, cooperative agreement, task order for a federally funded research and development center, or other transaction administered by the Department.

#### (b) Requirements
* Each listing described in subsection (a) shall include, at a minimum, for each listed project, the Department office carrying out the project, the project name, an abstract or summary of the project, funding levels, project duration, contractor or grantee name (including the names of any subcontractors), and expected objectives and milestones.

#### (c) Relevant literature and patents

* The Secretary shall carry out the Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program of the Department, as announced by the Secretary on December 8, 2011, in accordance with this section.

#### (b) Terms
* Each agreement entered into pursuant to the pilot program referred to in subsection (a) shall provide to the contractor of the applicable National Laboratory, to the maximum extent determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, increased authority to negotiate contract terms, such as intellectual property rights, payment structures, performance guarantees, and multiparty collaborations.

#### (c) Eligibility
* #### (1) In general
  * Any director of a National Laboratory may enter into an agreement pursuant to the pilot program referred to in subsection (a).
