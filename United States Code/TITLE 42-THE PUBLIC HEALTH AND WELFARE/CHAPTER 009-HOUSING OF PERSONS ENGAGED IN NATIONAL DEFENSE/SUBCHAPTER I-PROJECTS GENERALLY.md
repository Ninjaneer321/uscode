### SUBCHAPTER I—PROJECTS GENERALLY

### §1501. Cooperation between departments; definitions; limitation of projects
* In connection with the national defense program, the Departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development are authorized to cooperate in making necessary housing available for persons engaged in national defense activities, as provided in this subchapter. "Persons engaged in national defense activities" (as that term is used in this subchapter) shall include (i) enlisted men with families, who are in the naval and military service and officers of the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps not above the grade of captain, and officers of the Navy and Coast Guard, not above the grade of lieutenant and employees of the Departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force who are assigned to duty at naval or military reservations, posts, or bases, and (ii) workers with families, who are engaged or to be engaged in industries connected with and essential to the national defense program. No project shall be developed or assisted for the purposes of this subchapter except with the approval of the President and upon a determination by him that there is an acute shortage of housing in the locality involved which impedes the national defense program.

### §1502. Initiation and development of projects; jurisdiction; acquisition of property; fees of architects, engineers, etc.
* (a) Projects may be initiated under this subchapter by the Department of the Navy or Army or the Air Force to provide dwellings on or near naval or military reservations, posts or bases for rental to the officers, enlisted men and employees of the Departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force described in section 1501 of this title. Such projects shall be developed by the Department of the Navy or Army or the Air Force or by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, whichever the President determines is better suited to the fulfillment of the purposes of this subchapter with respect to any particular project. If the development of such project is to be undertaken by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to aid the development of the project by furnishing technical assistance and by transferring to such Department the funds necessary for the development of the project. Any project developed for the purpose of this section shall be leased to the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (who shall have title to such project until repayment of the cost thereof to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as prescribed in such lease) upon such terms as shall be prescribed in the lease, which may be the same terms as are authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], with respect to leases to public housing agencies. All the provisions of said Act which apply to the development of projects by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall (insofar as applicable and not inconsistent herewith) apply to the development of projects by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force. Notwithstanding other provisions of this or any other law, the Department leasing a project shall have the same jurisdiction over such project as it has over the reservation, post or base in connection with which the project is developed.

* (b) The Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force, in connection with any project developed or leased by it, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in connection with any project developed or assisted by him, for the purposes of this subchapter, may acquire real or personal property or any interest therein by purchase, eminent domain, gift, lease or otherwise. The provisions of sections 3111 and 3112 of title 40 shall not apply to the acquisition of any real property by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force or by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the purposes of this subchapter or to the project developed thereon, and the provisions of section 1302 of title 40, shall not apply to any lease of any project developed for the purposes of this subchapter or of any dwelling therein. Condemnation proceedings instituted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be in the Secretary's own name and the practice and procedure governing such proceedings by the United States shall be followed, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall likewise be entitled to proceed in accordance with the provisions of sections 3114 to 3116 and 3118 of title 40 and an Act of Congress approved March 1, 1929 (45 Stat. 1415). If the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development acquires land in connection with a project to be assisted for the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary may convey such land to the public housing agency involved for a consideration equal to the cost of the land to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may negotiate, contract and fix such fees as they determine are reasonable for the services of architects, engineers, surveyors, appraisers, title examiners and real estate negotiators in connection with specific projects developed by them under this subchapter. The Secretaries of Navy, Army, and Air Force are authorized to make available to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development any land that is needed for a project to be developed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and leased to the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force and to execute such leases, agreements and other instruments with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.

### §1503. Development of projects by Secretary; financial assistance to public housing agencies
* In any localities where the President determines that there is an acute shortage of housing which impedes the national defense program and that the necessary housing would not otherwise be provided when needed for persons engaged in national defense activities, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may undertake the development and administration of projects to assure the availability of dwellings in such localities for such persons and their families, or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may extend financial assistance of public housing agencies for the development and administration of such projects. Such financial assistance to public housing agencies shall be extended (except as otherwise provided herein and not inconsistent herewith) under the provisions of, and in the same manner and forms as provided in, title I of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], with respect to other housing projects.

### §1504. Rental rates; exemption from limitations of United States Housing Act of 1937
* Any contract made for financial assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], may be revised so as to provide that the project involved will be assisted for any of the purposes of this subchapter. The Department of the Navy or Army or the Air Force or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in the administration of any project developed for the purposes of this subchapter, shall fix rentals for persons engaged in national defense activities and their families which will be within their financial reach, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in any contract for financial assistance or any lease of such a project, shall require the fixing of such rentals. Projects developed by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force, or developed or assisted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for the purposes of this subchapter shall not be subject to the elimination requirements of sections 10(a) and 11(a) of said Act [42 U.S.C. 1410(a), 1411(a)], or to any provisions of section 9 of said Act [42 U.S.C. 1409] which would require any part of the development cost thereof to be met in any manner other than from funds loaned or furnished by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Funds expended for the purposes of this subchapter shall be excluded in determining, for the purposes of section 21(d) of said Act [42 U.S.C. 1421(d)], the amounts expended within each State. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter or as may be inconsistent with this subchapter, all the provisions of title I of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] shall apply to this subchapter. During the period when the President determines that in any locality there is an acute need for housing to assure the availability of dwellings for persons engaged in national defense activities, dwellings in a project developed or assisted in said locality which are devoted to the purposes of providing housing for persons engaged in national defense activities shall not be subject to sections 2(1) and 2(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended [42 U.S.C. 1402(1), (2)], and during such period such projects shall be deemed projects of a low-rent character for the purposes of any of the applicable provisions in title I of the United States Housing Act of 1937.

### §1505. Funds of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
* The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may use for the purposes of this subchapter any of the funds or authorizations heretofore or hereafter made available to it.

### §1506. Administration of utilities and utility services; granting of easements
* (a) Any Federal agency (including any wholly owned Government corporation) administering utility installations connected to a utility system for housing under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized—

  * (1) to continue to provide utilities and utility services to such housing as long as it is under the jurisdiction of the Secretary;

  * (2) to contract with the purchasers or transferees of such housing to continue the utility connection with such installations and furnish such utilities and services as may be available and needed in connection with such housing, for such period of time (not exceeding the period of Federal administration of such installations) and subject to such terms (including the payment of the pro rata cost to the Government or the market value of the utilities and services furnished, whichever is greater) as may be determined by the head of the agency;

  * (3) to dispose of such installations, when excess to the needs of the agency, and where not excess to grant an option to purchase, to the purchasers or transferees of such housing, for an amount not less than the appraised value of the installations and upon such terms and conditions as the head of the agency shall establish.


* (b) Any Federal agency (including any wholly owned Government corporation) having under its jurisdiction lands across which run any part of a utility system for housing under the jurisdiction of the Secretary is authorized to grant to the Secretary, or to the purchasers or transferees of such housing, easements (which may be perpetual) on such land for utility purposes.
