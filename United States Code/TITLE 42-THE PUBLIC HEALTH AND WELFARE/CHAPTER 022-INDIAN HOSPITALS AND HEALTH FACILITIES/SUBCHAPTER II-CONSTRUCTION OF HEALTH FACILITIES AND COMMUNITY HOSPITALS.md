### SUBCHAPTER II—CONSTRUCTION OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND COMMUNITY HOSPITALS

### §2005. Financial assistance by Surgeon General
* Whenever the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service, in carrying out his functions under subchapter I of this chapter with respect to the provision of health services to Indians in any particular area, determines, after consultation with such Indians, that the provision of financial assistance to one or more public or other nonprofit agencies or organizations for the construction of a community hospital constitutes a method of making needed hospital facilities available for such Indians which is more desirable and effective than direct Federal construction, he may provide such financial assistance from funds available for the construction of Indian health facilities for such Indians.

### §2005a. Amount of assistance; determination of costs
* The amount of such financial assistance shall not exceed that portion of the reasonable cost of the construction project which is attributable to the Indian health needs, as determined by the Surgeon General: _Provided_, That in determining, for the purposes of this subchapter, the portion of the cost of the construction project attributable to Indian health needs, the Surgeon General shall take into account only those categories of Indians for which hospital and medical care, including outpatient care and field health services, is being provided by or at the expense of the Public Health Service on August 16, 1957.

### §2005b. Conditions of assistance
* As a condition to providing assistance under section 2005 of this title, the Surgeon General shall—

  * (a) require plans and specifications meeting such standards of construction and equipment as he may prescribe, and

  * (b) obtain such assurances and agreements as in his judgment are equitable in the light of the financial assistance provided under this subchapter and are necessary to assure the availability of the facility for the provision of hospital and medical care to Indians and to assure that the hospital is operated in compliance with State standards for operation and maintenance of hospitals which receive Federal aid under title VI of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 291 et seq.].

### §2005c. Payments
* The Surgeon General shall make payments under section 2005 of this title in advance or by way of reimbursement and in such installments consistent with construction progress, as he may determine.

### §2005d. Eligibility of assisted project for aid under other acts; excluded costs
* Neither assistance provided under this subchapter for meeting part of the cost of construction of a hospital project, nor the giving of any assurance required as a condition of such assistance, shall be construed as affecting in any way the eligibility of such project for aid under title VI of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 291 et seq.] or any other Federal Act authorizing financial aid in the construction of such project, but construction costs met with Federal funds made available under this subchapter shall not be included in the cost of construction in which the Federal Government shares under such title VI or other Federal Act.
