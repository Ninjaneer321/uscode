#### (a) In general
* Not later than 90 days after March 23, 2010, the Secretary shall establish a temporary high risk health insurance pool program to provide health insurance coverage for eligible individuals during the period beginning on the date on which such program is established and ending on January 1, 2014.

#### (b) Administration
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary may carry out the program under this section directly or through contracts to eligible entities.

  * To be eligible to enter into a contract with the Secretary under this subsection, a State shall agree not to reduce the annual amount the State expended for the operation of one or more State high risk pools during the year preceding the year in which such contract is entered into.

#### (c) Qualified high risk pool
* #### (1) In general
  * Amounts made available under this section shall be used to establish a qualified high risk pool that meets the requirements of paragraph (2).

* #### (2) Requirements

    * (B) provides health insurance coverage—

      * (i) in which the issuer's share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under such coverage is not less than 65 percent of such costs; and

      * (ii) that has an out of pocket limit not greater than the applicable amount described in section 223(c)(2) of title 26 for the year involved, except that the Secretary may modify such limit if necessary to ensure the pool meets the actuarial value limit under clause (i);

  * (2) has not been covered under creditable coverage (as defined in section 300gg(c)(1) of this title as in effect on March 23, 2010) during the 6-month period prior to the date on which such individual is applying for coverage through the high risk pool; and

  * (3) has a pre-existing condition, as determined in a manner consistent with guidance issued by the Secretary.

#### (e) Protection against dumping risk by insurers
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall establish criteria for determining whether health insurance issuers and employment-based health plans have discouraged an individual from remaining enrolled in prior coverage based on that individual's health status.

* #### (2) Sanctions
  * An issuer or employment-based health plan shall be responsible for reimbursing the program under this section for the medical expenses incurred by the program for an individual who, based on criteria established by the Secretary, the Secretary finds was encouraged by the issuer to disenroll from health benefits coverage prior to enrolling in coverage through the program. The criteria shall include at least the following circumstances:

    * (A) In the case of prior coverage obtained through an employer, the provision by the employer, group health plan, or the issuer of money or other financial consideration for disenrolling from the coverage.

    * (B) In the case of prior coverage obtained directly from an issuer or under an employment-based health plan—

      * (i) the provision by the issuer or plan of money or other financial consideration for disenrolling from the coverage; or

      * (ii) in the case of an individual whose premium for the prior coverage exceeded the premium required by the program (adjusted based on the age factors applied to the prior coverage)—

        * (I) the prior coverage is a policy that is no longer being actively marketed (as defined by the Secretary) by the issuer; or

        * (II) the prior coverage is a policy for which duration of coverage form issue or health status are factors that can be considered in determining premiums at renewal.

* #### (3) Construction
  * Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as constituting exclusive remedies for violations of criteria established under paragraph (1) or as preventing States from applying or enforcing such paragraph or other provisions under law with respect to health insurance issuers.

#### (f) Oversight
* The Secretary shall establish—

  * (1) an appeals process to enable individuals to appeal a determination under this section; and

  * (2) procedures to protect against waste, fraud, and abuse.

* #### (1) In general
  * There is appropriated to the Secretary, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000,000 to pay claims against (and the administrative costs of) the high risk pool under this section that are in excess of the amount of premiums collected from eligible individuals enrolled in the high risk pool. Such funds shall be available without fiscal year limitation.

* #### (2) Insufficient funds
  * If the Secretary estimates for any fiscal year that the aggregate amounts available for the payment of the expenses of the high risk pool will be less than the actual amount of such expenses, the Secretary shall make such adjustments as are necessary to eliminate such deficit.

* #### (3) Termination of authority
  * #### (A) In general
    * Except as provided in subparagraph (B), coverage of eligible individuals under a high risk pool in a State shall terminate on January 1, 2014.

  * #### (B) Transition to Exchange
    * The Secretary shall develop procedures to provide for the transition of eligible individuals enrolled in health insurance coverage offered through a high risk pool established under this section into qualified health plans offered through an Exchange. Such procedures shall ensure that there is no lapse in coverage with respect to the individual and may extend coverage after the termination of the risk pool involved, if the Secretary determines necessary to avoid such a lapse.

In determining the amount of a claim for purposes of this subsection, the participating employment-based plan shall take into account any negotiated price concessions (such as discounts, direct or indirect subsidies, rebates, and direct or indirect remunerations) obtained by such plan with respect to such health benefit.
