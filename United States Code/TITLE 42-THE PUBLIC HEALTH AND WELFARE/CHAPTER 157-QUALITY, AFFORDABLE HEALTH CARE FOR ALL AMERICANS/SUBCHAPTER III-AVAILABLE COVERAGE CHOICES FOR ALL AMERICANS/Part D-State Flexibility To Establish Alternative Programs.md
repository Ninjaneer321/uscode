### §18051. State flexibility to establish basic health programs for low-income individuals not eligible for medicaid
#### (a) Establishment of program
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall establish a basic health program meeting the requirements of this section under which a State may enter into contracts to offer 1 or more standard health plans providing at least the essential health benefits described in section 18022(b) of this title to eligible individuals in lieu of offering such individuals coverage through an Exchange.

* #### (2) Certifications as to benefit coverage and costs
  * Such program shall provide that a State may not establish a basic health program under this section unless the State establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary, and the Secretary certifies, that—

    * (A) in the case of an eligible individual enrolled in a standard health plan offered through the program, the State provides—

      * (i) that the amount of the monthly premium an eligible individual is required to pay for coverage under the standard health plan for the individual and the individual's dependents does not exceed the amount of the monthly premium that the eligible individual would have been required to pay (in the rating area in which the individual resides) if the individual had enrolled in the applicable second lowest cost silver plan (as defined in section 36B(b)(3)(B) of title 26) offered to the individual through an Exchange; and

      * (ii) that the cost-sharing an eligible individual is required to pay under the standard health plan does not exceed—

        * (I) the cost-sharing required under a platinum plan in the case of an eligible individual with household income not in excess of 150 percent of the poverty line for the size of the family involved; and

        * (II) the cost-sharing required under a gold plan in the case of an eligible individual not described in subclause (I); and


    * (B) the benefits provided under the standard health plans offered through the program cover at least the essential health benefits described in section 18022(b) of this title.


* For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the amount of the monthly premium an individual is required to pay under either the standard health plan or the applicable second lowest cost silver plan shall be determined after reduction for any premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions allowable with respect to either plan.

#### (b) Standard health plan
* In this section, the term "standard heath plan" means a health benefits plan that the State contracts with under this section—

  * (1) under which the only individuals eligible to enroll are eligible individuals;

  * (2) that provides at least the essential health benefits described in section 18022(b) of this title; and

#### (c) Contracting process
* #### (1) In general
  * A State basic health program shall establish a competitive process for entering into contracts with standard health plans under subsection (a), including negotiation of premiums and cost-sharing and negotiation of benefits in addition to the essential health benefits described in section 18022(b) of this title.

* #### (2) Specific items to be considered
  * A State shall, as part of its competitive process under paragraph (1), include at least the following:

      * (ii) incentives for use of preventive services; and

      * (iii) the establishment of relationships between providers and patients that maximize patient involvement in health care decision-making, including providing incentives for appropriate utilization under the plan.

  * #### (B) Health and resource differences
    * Consideration of, and the making of suitable allowances for, differences in health care needs of enrollees and differences in local availability of, and access to, health care providers. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as allowing discrimination on the basis of pre-existing conditions or other health status-related factors.

  * #### (C) Managed care
    * Contracting with managed care systems, or with systems that offer as many of the attributes of managed care as are feasible in the local health care market.

  * #### (D) Performance measures
    * Establishing specific performance measures and standards for issuers of standard health plans that focus on quality of care and improved health outcomes, requiring such plans to report to the State with respect to the measures and standards, and making the performance and quality information available to enrollees in a useful form.

* #### (3) Enhanced availability
  * #### (A) Multiple plans
    * A State shall, to the maximum extent feasible, seek to make multiple standard health plans available to eligible individuals within a State to ensure individuals have a choice of such plans.

  * #### (B) Regional compacts
    * A State may negotiate a regional compact with other States to include coverage of eligible individuals in all such States in agreements with issuers of standard health plans.

* #### (4) Coordination with other State programs
  * A State shall seek to coordinate the administration of, and provision of benefits under, its program under this section with the State medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], the State child health plan under title XXI of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.], and other State-administered health programs to maximize the efficiency of such programs and to improve the continuity of care.

#### (d) Transfer of funds to States
* #### (1) In general
  * If the Secretary determines that a State electing the application of this section meets the requirements of the program established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall transfer to the State for each fiscal year for which 1 or more standard health plans are operating within the State the amount determined under paragraph (3).

* #### (2) Use of funds
  * A State shall establish a trust for the deposit of the amounts received under paragraph (1) and amounts in the trust fund shall only be used to reduce the premiums and cost-sharing of, or to provide additional benefits for, eligible individuals enrolled in standard health plans within the State. Amounts in the trust fund, and expenditures of such amounts, shall not be included in determining the amount of any non-Federal funds for purposes of meeting any matching or expenditure requirement of any federally-funded program.

* #### (3) Amount of payment
  * #### (A) Secretarial determination
    * #### (i) In general
      * The amount determined under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the amount the Secretary determines is equal to 95 percent of the premium tax credits under section 36B of title 26, and the cost-sharing reductions under section 18071 of this title, that would have been provided for the fiscal year to eligible individuals enrolled in standard health plans in the State if such eligible individuals were allowed to enroll in qualified health plans through an Exchange established under this subchapter.

    * #### (ii) Specific requirements
      * The Secretary shall make the determination under clause (i) on a per enrollee basis and shall take into account all relevant factors necessary to determine the value of the premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that would have been provided to eligible individuals described in clause (i), including the age and income of the enrollee, whether the enrollment is for self-only or family coverage, geographic differences in average spending for health care across rating areas, the health status of the enrollee for purposes of determining risk adjustment payments and reinsurance payments that would have been made if the enrollee had enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange, and whether any reconciliation of the credit or cost-sharing reductions would have occurred if the enrollee had been so enrolled. This determination shall take into consideration the experience of other States with respect to participation in an Exchange and such credits and reductions provided to residents of the other States, with a special focus on enrollees with income below 200 percent of poverty.

    * #### (iii) Certification
      * The Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in consultation with the Office of Tax Analysis of the Department of the Treasury, shall certify whether the methodology used to make determinations under this subparagraph, and such determinations, meet the requirements of clause (ii). Such certifications shall be based on sufficient data from the State and from comparable States about their experience with programs created by this Act.

  * #### (B) Corrections
    * The Secretary shall adjust the payment for any fiscal year to reflect any error in the determinations under subparagraph (A) for any preceding fiscal year.
