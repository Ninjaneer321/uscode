### SUBCHAPTER V—SPACE SHUTTLE RETIREMENT AND TRANSITION

### §18361. Sense of Congress on the Space Shuttle program
#### (a) Findings
* Congress makes the following findings:

  * (1) The Space Shuttle program represents a national asset consisting of critical skills and capabilities, including the ability to lift large payloads into space and return them to Earth.

  * (2) The Space Shuttle has carried more than 355 people from 16 nations into space.

  * (3) The Space Shuttle has projected the best of American values around the world, and Space Shuttle crews have sparked the imagination and dreams of the world's youth and young at heart.

#### (b) Sense of Congress
* It is the sense of Congress that—

  * (1) it is essential that the retirement of the Space Shuttle and the transition to new human space flight capabilities be done in a manner that builds upon the legacy of this national asset; and

  * (2) it is imperative for the United States to retain the skills and the industrial capability to provide a follow-on Space Launch System that is primarily designed for missions beyond near-Earth space, while offering some potential for supplanting shuttle delivery capabilities to low-Earth orbit, particularly in support of ISS requirements, if necessary.

### §18362. Retirement of Space Shuttle orbiters and transition of Space Shuttle program
#### (a) In general
* The Administrator shall retire the Space Shuttle orbiters pursuant to a schedule established by the Administrator and in a manner consistent with provisions of this chapter regarding potential requirements for contingency utilization of Space Shuttle orbiters for ISS requirements.

#### (b) Utilization of workforce and assets in follow-on Space Launch System
* #### (1) Utilization of vehicle assets
  * In carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize workforce, assets, and infrastructure of the Space Shuttle program in efforts relating to the initiation of a follow-on Space Launch System developed pursuant to section 18322 of this title.

* #### (2) Other assets
  * With respect to the workforce, assets, and infrastructure not utilized as described in paragraph (1), the Administrator shall work closely with other departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and the private sector, to divest unneeded assets and to assist displaced workers with retraining and other placement efforts. Amounts authorized to be appropriated by section 101(2)(B) shall be available for activities pursuant to this paragraph.

### §18363. Disposition of orbiter vehicles
#### (a) In general
* Upon the termination of the Space Shuttle program as provided in section 18362 of this title, the Administrator shall decommission any remaining Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles according to established safety and historic preservation procedures prior to their designation as surplus government property. The orbiter vehicles shall be made available and located for display and maintenance through a competitive procedure established pursuant to the disposition plan developed under section 613(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (42 U.S.C. 17761(a)), with priority consideration given to eligible applicants meeting all conditions of that plan which would provide for the display and maintenance of orbiters at locations with the best potential value to the public, including where the location of the orbiters can advance educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, and with an historical relationship with either the launch, flight operations, or processing of the Space Shuttle orbiters or the retrieval of NASA manned space vehicles, or significant contributions to human space flight. The Smithsonian Institution, which, as of October 11, 2001, houses the Space Shuttle Enterprise, shall determine any new location for the Enterprise.

#### (b) Display and maintenance
* The orbiter vehicles made available under subsection (a) shall be displayed and maintained through agreements and procedures established pursuant to section 613(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (42 U.S.C. 17761(a)).

#### (c) Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated to NASA such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section. The amounts authorized to be appropriated by this subsection shall be in addition to any amounts authorized to be appropriated by title I, and may be requested by the President as supplemental requirements, if needed, in the appropriate fiscal years.
