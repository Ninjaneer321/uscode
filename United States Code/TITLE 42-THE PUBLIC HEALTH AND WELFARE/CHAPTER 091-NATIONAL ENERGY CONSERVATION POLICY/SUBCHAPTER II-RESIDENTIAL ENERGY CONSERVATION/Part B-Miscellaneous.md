### PART B—MISCELLANEOUS

### §8231. Grants for energy conserving improvements; establishment of standards; authorization of appropriations
* (1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to make grants to finance energy conserving improvements (as defined in subparagraph (2) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of title 12) to projects which are financed with loans under section 1701q of title 12, or which are subject to mortgages insured under section 1715l(d)(3) or section 1715z–1 of title 12. The Secretary shall make assistance available under this section on a priority basis to those projects which are in financial difficulty as a result of high energy costs. In carrying out the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall issue regulations requiring that any grant made under this section shall be made only on the condition that the recipient of such grant shall take steps (prescribed by the Secretary) to assure that the benefits derived from such grants in terms of lower energy costs shall accrue to tenants in the form of lower rentals or to the Federal Government in the form of a lower operating subsidy if such a subsidy is being paid to such recipient.

* (2) The Secretary shall establish minimum standards for energy conserving improvements to multifamily dwelling units to be assisted under this section.

* (3) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this section not to exceed $25,000,000.

### §8232. Residential energy efficiency standards study
#### (a) General authority
* The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "Secretary") shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Energy, and such other representatives of Federal, State, and local governments as the Secretary shall designate, conduct a study, utilizing the services of the National Institute of Building Sciences pursuant to appropriate contractual arrangements, for the purpose of determining the need for, the feasibility of, and the problems of requiring, by mandatory Federal action, that all residential dwelling units meet applicable energy efficient standards. The subjects to be examined shall include, but not be limited to, mandatory notification to purchasers, and policies to prohibit exchange or sale, of properties which do not conform to such standards.

#### (b) Specific factors
* In conducting such study, the Secretary shall consider at least the following factors—

  * (1) the extent to which such requirement would protect a prospective purchaser from the uncertainty of not knowing the energy efficiency of the property he proposes to purchase;

  * (2) the extent to which such requirement would contribute to the Nation's energy conservation goals;

  * (3) the extent to which such a requirement would affect the real estate, home building, and mortgage banking industries;

  * (4) the sanctions which might be necessary to make such a requirement effective and the administrative impediments there might be to enforcement of such sanctions;

  * (5) the possible impact on sellers and purchasers as a result of the implementation of mandatory Federal actions, taking into account the experience of the Federal Government in imposing mandatory requirements concerning the purchase and sale of real property as occurred under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 [12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.] and the Federal Disaster Protection Act of 1973;

  * (6) an analysis of the effect of such a requirement on the economy as a whole and on the Nation's security as compared to the impact on the credit and housing markets caused by such a requirement;

  * (7) the effect of such a requirement on availability of credit in the housing industry;

  * (8) the extent to which the imposition of mandatory Federal requirements would temporarily reduce the number of residential dwellings available for sale and the resulting effect of such mandatory actions on the price of those remaining dwelling units eligible for sale; and

  * (9) the possible uncertainty, during the period of developing the standards, as to what standards might be imposed and any resulting effect on major housing rehabilitation efforts and voluntary efforts for energy conservation.

#### (c) Comments and findings by Secretary of Energy
* The Secretary shall incorporate into such study comments by the Secretary of Energy on the effects on the economy as a whole and on the Nation's security which may result from the requirement described in subsection (a) as compared to the impact on the credit and housing markets likely to be caused by such a requirement. In addition, the Secretary shall incorporate into such study the following findings by the Secretary of Energy:

  * (1) the savings in energy costs resulting from the requirement described in subsection (a) throughout the estimated remaining useful life of the existing residential buildings to which such requirement would apply; and

  * (2) the total cost per barrel of oil equivalent, in obtaining the energy savings likely to result from such requirement, computed for each class of existing residential buildings to which such requirement would apply.

#### (d) Report date
* The Secretary shall report, no later than one year after November 9, 1978, to both Houses of the Congress with regard to the findings made as a result of such study along with any recommendations for legislative proposals which the Secretary determines should be enacted with respect to the subject of such study.

### §8233. Weatherization study
* The President shall conduct a study which shall monitor the weatherization activities authorized by this Act and amendments made thereby and those weatherization activities undertaken, independently of this Act and such amendments. The President shall report to the Congress within one year from November 9, 1978, and annually thereafter, concerning—

  * (1) the extent of progress being made through weatherization activities toward the achievement of national energy conservation goals;

  * (2) adequacy and costs of materials necessary for weatherization activities; and

  * (3) the need for and desirability of modifying weatherization activities authorized by this Act, and amendments made thereby and of extending such activities to a broader range of income groups than are being assisted under this Act and such amendments.
