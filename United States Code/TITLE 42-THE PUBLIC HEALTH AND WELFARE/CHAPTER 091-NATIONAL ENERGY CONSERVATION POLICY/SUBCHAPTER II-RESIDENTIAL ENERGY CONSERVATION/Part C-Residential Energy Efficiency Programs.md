  * (1) the entering into a contract by a public utility with one or more persons not under the control of, and not affiliates or subsidiaries of, such utility for the implementation of a program to encourage energy conservation, including the supply and installation of the energy conservation measures as specified in such contract in residential buildings located in the portion of the utility's service area designated by the contract, which contract includes the provisions described in subsection (b);

  * (2) the selection by the public utility in a fair, open, and nondiscriminatory manner of the person or persons to contract with pursuant to paragraph (1);

  * (3) the payment by the public utility to the person or persons contracted with under paragraph (1) of a specified price for each unit of energy saved by such utility as a result of the program during the period the contract is in effect, which price is based on the value to the utility of the energy saved;
