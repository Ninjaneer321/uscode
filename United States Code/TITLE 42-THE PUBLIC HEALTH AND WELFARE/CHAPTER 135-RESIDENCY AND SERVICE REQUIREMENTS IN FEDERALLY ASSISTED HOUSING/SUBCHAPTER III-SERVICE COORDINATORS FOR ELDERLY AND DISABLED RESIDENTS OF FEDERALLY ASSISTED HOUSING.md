The services may be provided through any agency of the Federal Government or any other public or private department, agency, or organization.

#### (d) Covered federally assisted housing
* For purposes of this subtitle, the term "covered federally assisted housing" means housing that is federally assisted housing (as such term is defined in section 13641(2) of this title), except that such term does not include housing described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of such section.

#### (e) Services for low-income elderly or disabled families residing in vicinity of certain projects
* To the extent only that this section applies to service coordinators for covered federally assisted housing described in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), and (G) of section 13641(2) of this title, any reference in this section to elderly or disabled residents of a project shall be construed to include low-income elderly or disabled families living in the vicinity of such project.

#### (f) Protection against telemarketing fraud
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall establish standards for service coordinators in federally assisted housing who are providing education and outreach to elderly persons residing in such housing regarding telemarketing fraud. The standards shall be designed to ensure that such education and outreach informs such elderly persons of the dangers of telemarketing fraud and facilitates the investigation and prosecution of telemarketers engaging in fraud against such residents.

* #### (2) Contents
  * The standards established under this subsection shall require that any such education and outreach be provided in a manner that—

    * (A) informs such residents of—

      * (i) the prevalence of telemarketing fraud targeted against elderly persons;

      * (ii) how telemarketing fraud works;

      * (v) how to report suspected attempts at telemarketing fraud; and

      * (vi) their consumer protection rights under Federal law;


    * (B) provides such other information as the Secretary considers necessary to protect such residents against fraudulent telemarketing; and

    * (C) disseminates the information provided by appropriate means, and in determining such appropriate means, the Secretary shall consider on-site presentations at federally assisted housing, public service announcements, a printed manual or pamphlet, an Internet website, and telephone outreach to residents whose names appear on "mooch lists" confiscated from fraudulent telemarketers.

### §13632. Grants for costs of providing service coordinators in certain federally assisted housing
#### (a) Authority
* The Secretary may make grants under this section to owners of federally assisted housing projects described in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), and (G) of section 13641(2) of this title.
