### SUBCHAPTER II—AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE PREFERENCES FOR ELDERLY RESIDENTS AND UNITS FOR DISABLED RESIDENTS IN CERTAIN SECTION 8 ASSISTED HOUSING

### §13611. Authority
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner of a covered section 8 housing project (as such term is defined in section 13619 of this title) designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families may, in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available for occupancy, give preference to elderly families who have applied for occupancy in the housing, subject to the requirements of this subchapter.

### §13612. Reservation of units for disabled families
#### (a) Requirement
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for any project for which an owner gives preference in occupancy to elderly families pursuant to section 13611 of this title, such owner shall (subject to sections 13613, 13614, and 13615 of this title) reserve units in the project for occupancy only by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly families (and who have applied for occupancy in the housing) in the number determined under subsection (b).

#### (b) Number of units
* Each owner required to reserve units in a project for occupancy under subsection (a) shall reserve a number of units in the project that is not less than the lesser of—

  * (1) the number of units equivalent to the higher of—

    * (A) the percentage of units in the project that were occupied by such disabled families upon October 28, 1992; or

    * (B) the percentage of units in the project that were occupied by such families upon January 1, 1992; or


  * (2) 10 percent of the number of units in the project.

### §13613. Secondary preferences
#### (a) Insufficient elderly families
* If an owner of a covered section 8 housing project in which elderly families are given a preference for occupancy pursuant to section 13611 of this title determines (in accordance with regulations established by the Secretary) that there are insufficient numbers of elderly families who have applied for occupancy in the housing to fill all the units in the project not reserved under section 13612 of this title, the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families and have applied for occupancy in the housing.

#### (b) Insufficient non-elderly disabled families
* If an owner of a covered section 8 housing project in which elderly families are given a preference for occupancy pursuant to section 13611 of this title determines (in accordance with regulations established by the Secretary) that there are insufficient numbers of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly families and have applied for occupancy in the housing to fill all the units in the project reserved under section 13612 of this title, the owner may give preference for occupancy of units so reserved to disabled families who are near-elderly families and have applied for occupancy in the housing.

### §13614. General availability of units
* If an owner of a covered section 8 housing project in which disabled families who are near-elderly families are given a preference for occupancy pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of section 13613 of this title determines (in accordance with regulations established by the Secretary) that there are an insufficient number of such families to fill all the units in the project for which the preference is applicable, the owner shall make such units generally available for occupancy by families who have applied, and are eligible, for occupancy in the housing, without regard to the preferences established pursuant to this subchapter.

### §13615. Preference within groups
* Among disabled families qualifying for occupancy in units reserved under section 13612 of this title, and among elderly families and near-elderly families qualifying for preference for occupancy pursuant to section 13611 or 13613 of this title, preference for occupancy in units that are assisted under section 1437f of this title shall be given to disabled families according to any preferences established under any system established under section 1437f(d)(1)(A) of this title by the public housing agency.

### §13616. Prohibition of evictions
* Any tenant who, except for reservation of a percentage of the units of a project pursuant to section 13612 of this title or any preference for occupancy established pursuant to this subchapter, is lawfully residing in a dwelling unit in a covered section 8 housing project, may not be evicted or otherwise required to vacate such unit because of the reservation or preferences or because of any action taken by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or the owner of the project pursuant to this subchapter.

### §13617. Treatment of covered section 8 housing not subject to elderly preference
* If an owner of any covered section 8 housing project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families does not give preference in occupancy to elderly families as authorized in this subchapter, then elderly families (as such term was defined in section 1437a of this title before October 28, 1992) shall be eligible for occupancy in such housing to the same extent that such families were eligible before October 28, 1992.

### §13618. Treatment of other federally assisted housing

#### (b) Prohibition of evictions
* Any tenant who is lawfully residing in a dwelling unit in a housing project described in subsection (a) may not be evicted or otherwise required to vacate such unit because of any reservation or preferences under this subchapter or because of any action taken by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or the owner of the project pursuant to this subchapter.

### §13619. "Covered section 8 housing" defined

### §13620. Study
