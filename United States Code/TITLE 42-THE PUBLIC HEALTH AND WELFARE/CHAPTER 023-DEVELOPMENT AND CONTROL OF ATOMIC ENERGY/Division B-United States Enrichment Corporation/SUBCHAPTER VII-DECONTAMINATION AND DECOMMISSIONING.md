### SUBCHAPTER VII—DECONTAMINATION AND DECOMMISSIONING

### §2297g. Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund
#### (a) Establishment
* There is established in the Treasury of the United States an account to be known as the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund (referred to in this subchapter as the "Fund"). The Fund, and any amounts deposited in it, including any interest earned thereon, shall be available to the Secretary subject to appropriations for the exclusive purpose of carrying out this subchapter.

#### (b) Administration
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary of the Treasury shall hold the Fund and, after consultation with the Secretary, annually report to the Congress on the financial condition and operations of the Fund during the preceding fiscal year.

* #### (2) Investments
  * The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest amounts contained within the Fund in obligations of the United States—

    * (A) having maturities determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be appropriate for what the Department determines to be the needs of the Fund; and

    * (B) bearing interest at rates determined to be appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to these obligations.

### §2297g–1. Deposits
#### (a) Amount
* The Fund shall consist of deposits in the amount of $518,233,333 per fiscal year (to be annually adjusted for inflation beginning on October 24, 1992, using the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor) as provided in this section.

#### (b) Source
* Deposits described in subsection (a) shall be from the following sources:

  * (1) Sums collected pursuant to subsection (c).

  * (2) Appropriations made pursuant to subsection (d).

#### (c) Special assessment
* The Secretary shall collect a special assessment from domestic utilities. The total amount collected for a fiscal year shall not exceed $150,000,000 (to be annually adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor). The amount collected from each utility pursuant to this subsection for a fiscal year shall be in the same ratio to the amount required under subsection (a) to be deposited for such fiscal year as the total amount of separative work units such utility has purchased from the Department of Energy for the purpose of commercial electricity generation, before October 24, 1992, bears to the total amount of separative work units purchased from the Department of Energy for all purposes (including units purchased or produced for defense purposes) before October 24, 1992. For purposes of this subsection—

  * (1) a utility shall be considered to have purchased a separative work unit from the Department if such separative work unit was produced by the Department, but purchased by the utility from another source; and

  * (2) a utility shall not be considered to have purchased a separative work unit from the Department if such separative work unit was purchased by the utility, but sold to another source.

#### (d) Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated to the Fund, for the period encompassing 15 years after October 24, 1992, such sums as are necessary to ensure that the amount required under subsection (a) is deposited for each fiscal year.

#### (e) Termination of assessments
* The collection of amounts under subsection (c) shall cease after the earlier of—

  * (1) 15 years after October 24, 1992; or

  * (2) the collection of $2,250,000,000 (to be annually adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor) under such subsection.

#### (f) Continuation of deposits
* Except as provided in subsection (e), deposits shall continue to be made into the Fund under subsection (d) for the period specified in such subsection.

#### (g) Treatment of assessment
* Any special assessment levied under this section on domestic utilities for the decontamination and decommissioning of the Department's gaseous diffusion enrichment facilities shall be deemed a necessary and reasonable current cost of fuel and shall be fully recoverable in rates in all jurisdictions in the same manner as the utility's other fuel cost.

### §2297g–2. Department facilities
#### (a) Study by National Academy of Sciences
* The National Academy of Sciences shall conduct a study and provide recommendations for reducing costs associated with decontamination and decommissioning, and shall report its findings to the Congress within 3 years after October 24, 1992. Such report shall include a determination of the decontamination and decommissioning required for each facility, shall identify alternative methods, using different technologies, shall include site-specific surveys of the actual contamination, and shall provide estimated costs of those activities.

#### (b) Payment of decontamination and decommissioning costs
* The costs of all decontamination and decommissioning activities of the Department shall be paid from the Fund until such time as the Secretary certifies and the Congress concurs, by law, that such activities are complete.

#### (c) Payment of remedial action costs
* The annual cost of remedial action at the Department's gaseous diffusion facilities shall be paid from the Fund to the extent the amount available in the Fund is sufficient. To the extent the amount in the Fund is insufficient, the Department shall be responsible for the cost of remedial action. No provision of this division may be construed to relieve in any way the responsibility or liability of the Department for remedial action under applicable Federal and State laws and regulations.

### §2297g–3. Employee provisions
* All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in the performance of decontamination or decommissioning of uranium enrichment facilities of the Department shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on projects of a similar character in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with sections 3141–3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40. The Secretary of Labor shall have, with respect to the labor standards specified in this section, the authority and functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (15 F.R. 3176, 64 Stat. 1267) and section 3145 of title 40. This section may not be construed to require the contracting out of activities associated with the decontamination or decommissioning of uranium enrichment facilities.

### §2297g–4. Reports to Congress
