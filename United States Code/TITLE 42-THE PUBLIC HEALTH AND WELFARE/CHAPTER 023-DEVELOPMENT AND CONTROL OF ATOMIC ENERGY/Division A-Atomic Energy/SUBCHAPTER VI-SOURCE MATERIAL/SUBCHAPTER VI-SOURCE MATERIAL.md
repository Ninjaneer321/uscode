### SUBCHAPTER VI—SOURCE MATERIAL

### §2091. Determination of source material
* The Commission may determine from time to time that other material is source material in addition to those specified in the definition of source material. Before making such determination, the Commission must find that such material is essential to the production of special nuclear material and must find that the determination that such material is source material is in the interest of the common defense and security, and the President must have expressly assented in writing to the determination. The Commission's determination, together with the assent of the President, shall be submitted to the Energy Committees and a period of thirty days shall elapse while Congress is in session (in computing such thirty days, there shall be excluded the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days) before the determination of the Commission may become effective: _Provided, however_, That the Energy Committees, after having received such determination, may by resolution in writing waive the conditions of or all or any portion of such thirty-day period.

### §2092. License requirements for transfers
* Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by the Commission which the Commission is authorized to issue, no person may transfer or receive in interstate commerce, transfer, deliver, receive possession of or title to, or import into or export from the United States any source material after removal from its place of deposit in nature, except that licenses shall not be required for quantities of source material which, in the opinion of the Commission, are unimportant.

### §2093. Domestic distribution of source material
#### (a) License
* The Commission is authorized to issue licenses for and to distribute source material within the United States to qualified applicants requesting such material—

  * (1) for the conduct of research and development activities of the types specified in section 2051 of this title;

  * (2) for use in the conduct of research and development activities or in medical therapy under a license issued pursuant to section 2134 of this title;

  * (3) for use under a license issued pursuant to section 2133 of this title; or

  * (4) for any other use approved by the Commission as an aid to science or industry.

#### (b) Minimum criteria for licenses
* The Commission shall establish, by rule, minimum criteria for the issuance of specific or general licenses for the distribution of source material depending upon the degree of importance to the common defense and security or to the health and safety of the public of—

  * (1) the physical characteristics of the source material to be distributed;

  * (2) the quantities of source material to be distributed; and

  * (3) the intended use of the source material to be distributed.

#### (c) Determination of charges
* The Commission may make a reasonable charge determined pursuant to section 2201(m) of this title for the source material licensed and distributed under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(4) and shall make a reasonable charge determined pursuant to section 2201(m) of this title, for the source material licensed and distributed under subsection (a)(3). The Commission shall establish criteria in writing for the determination of whether a charge will be made for the source material licensed and distributed under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(4), considering, among other things, whether the licensee is a nonprofit or eleemosynary institution and the purposes for which the source material will be used.

### §2094. Foreign distribution of source material
* The Commission is authorized to cooperate with any nation by distributing source material and to distribute source material pursuant to the terms of an agreement for cooperation to which such nation is a party and which is made in accordance with section 2153 of this title. The Commission is also authorized to distribute source material outside of the United States upon a determination by the Commission that such activity will not be inimical to the interests of the United States. The authority to distribute source material under this section other than under an export license granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall in no case extend to quantities of source material in excess of three metric tons per year per recipient.

### §2095. Reports
* The Commission is authorized to issue such rules, regulations, or orders requiring reports of ownership, possession, extraction, refining, shipment, or other handling of source material as it may deem necessary, except that such reports shall not be required with respect to (a) any source material prior to removal from its place of deposit in nature, or (b) quantities of source material which in the opinion of the Commission are unimportant or the reporting of which will discourage independent prospecting for new deposits.

### §2096. Acquisition of source material; payments
* The Commission is authorized and directed, to the extent it deems necessary to effectuate the provisions of this chapter—

  * (a) to purchase, take, requisition, condemn, or otherwise acquire supplies of source material;

  * (b) to purchase, condemn, or otherwise acquire any interest in real property containing deposits of source material; and

  * (c) to purchase, condemn, or otherwise acquire rights to enter upon any real property deemed by the Commission to have possibilities of containing deposits of source material in order to conduct prospecting and exploratory operations for such deposits.


* Any purchase made under this section may be made without regard to the provisions of section 6101 of title 41, upon certification by the Commission that such action is necessary in the interest of the common defense and security, or upon a showing by the Commission that advertising is not reasonably practicable. Partial and advanced payments may be made under contracts for such purposes. The Commission may establish guaranteed prices for all source material delivered to it within a specified time. Just compensation shall be made for any right, property, or interest in property taken, requisitioned, condemned, or otherwise acquired under this section.

### §2097. Operations on lands belonging to United States
* The Commission is authorized, to the extent it deems necessary to effectuate the provisions of this chapter, to issue leases or permits for prospecting for, exploration for, mining of, or removal of deposits of source material in lands belonging to the United States: _Provided, however_, That notwithstanding any other provisions of law, such leases or permits may be issued for lands administered for national park, monument, and wildlife purposes only when the President by Executive Order declares that the requirements of the common defense and security make such action necessary.

### §2098. Public and acquired lands
#### (a) Conditions on location, entry, and settlement
* No individual, corporation, partnership, or association, which had any part, directly or indirectly, in the development of the atomic energy program, may benefit by any location, entry, or settlement upon the public domain made after such individual, corporation, partnership, or association took part in such project, if such individual, corporation, partnership, or association, by reason of having had such part in the development of the atomic energy program, acquired confidential official information as to the existence of deposits of such uranium, thorium, or other materials in the specific lands upon which such location, entry, or settlement is made, and subsequent to August 30, 1954, made such location, entry, or settlement or caused the same to be made for his, or its, or their benefit.

#### (b) Reservation of mineral rights; release
* Any reservation of radioactive mineral substances, fissionable materials, or source material, together with the right to enter upon the land and prospect for, mine, and remove the same, inserted pursuant to Executive Order 9613 of September 13, 1945, Executive Order 9701 of March 4, 1946, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, or Executive Order 9908 of December 5, 1947, in any patent, conveyance, lease, permit, or other authorization or instrument disposing of any interest in public or acquired lands of the United States, is released, remised, and quitclaimed to the person or persons entitled upon August 19, 1958 under the grant from the United States or successive grants to the ownership, occupancy, or use of the land under the applicable Federal or State laws: _Provided, however_, That in cases where any such reservation on acquired lands of the United States has been heretofore released, remised, or quitclaimed subsequent to August 12, 1954, in reliance upon authority deemed to have been contained in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], as heretofore amended, the same shall be valid and effective in all respects to the same extent as if public lands and not acquired lands had been involved. The foregoing release shall be subject to any rights which may have been granted by the United States pursuant to any such reservation, but the releases shall be subrogated to the rights of the United States.

#### (c) Prior locations
* Notwithstanding the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, as amended, and particularly section 5(b)(7) thereof, or the provisions of sections 501 to 505 of title 30, and particularly section 503 of title 30, any mining claim, heretofore located under the mining laws of the United States, for or based upon a discovery of a mineral deposit which is a source material and which, except for the possible contrary construction of said Atomic Energy Act, would have been locatable under such mining laws, shall, insofar as adversely affected by such possible contrary construction, be valid and effective, in all respects to the same extent as if said mineral deposit were a locatable mineral deposit other than a source material.

### §2099. Prohibitions against issuance of license
* The Commission shall not license any person to transfer or deliver, receive possession of or title to, or import into or export from the United States any source material if, in the opinion of the Commission, the issuance of a license to such person for such purpose would be inimical to the common defense and security or the health and safety of the public.
