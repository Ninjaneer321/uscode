### §2295. Acquisition of nuclear materials
#### (a) Authorization; restriction of amounts of plutonium or uranium; amount and use of plutonium authorized to be acquired

#### (c) Terms and periods of contracts to acquire uranium
* Any contract made under the provisions of this section to acquire uranium enriched in the isotope uranium 235 may be at such price and for such period of time as the Commission may deem necessary: _Provided_, That no such contract shall be for a period of time extending beyond the terminal date of the agreement for cooperation with the Community or provide for the acquisition of uranium enriched in the isotope U–235 in excess of the quantities of such material that have been distributed to the Community by the Commission less the quantity consumed in the nuclear reactors involved in the joint program: _And provided further_, That no such contract shall provide for compensation or the payment of a purchase price in excess of the Atomic Energy Commission's established charges for such material in effect at the time delivery is made to the Commission.

#### (d) Contracts for purchase of special nuclear materials
