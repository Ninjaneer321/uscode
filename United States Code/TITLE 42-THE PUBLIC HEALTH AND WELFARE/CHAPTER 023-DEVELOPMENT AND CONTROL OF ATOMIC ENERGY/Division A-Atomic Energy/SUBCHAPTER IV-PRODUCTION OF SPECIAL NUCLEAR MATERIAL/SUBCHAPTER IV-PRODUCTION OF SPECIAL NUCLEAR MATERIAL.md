### SUBCHAPTER IV—PRODUCTION OF SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL

### §2061. Production facilities
#### (a) Ownership
* The Commission, as agent of and on behalf of the United States, shall be the exclusive owner of all production facilities other than facilities which (1) are useful in the conduct of research and development activities in the fields specified in section 2051 of this title, and do not, in the opinion of the Commission, have a potential production rate adequate to enable the user of such facilities to produce within a reasonable period of time a sufficient quantity of special nuclear material to produce an atomic weapon; (2) are licensed by the Commission under this division; or (3) are owned by the United States Enrichment Corporation.

#### (b) Operation of Commission's facilities
* The Commission is authorized and directed to produce or to provide for the production of special nuclear material in its own production facilities. To the extent deemed necessary, the Commission is authorized to make, or to continue in effect, contracts with persons obligating them to produce special nuclear material in facilities owned by the Commission. The Commission is also authorized to enter into research and development contracts authorizing the contractor to produce special nuclear material in facilities owned by the Commission to the extent that the production of such special nuclear material may be incident to the conduct of research and development activities under such contracts. Any contract entered into under this section shall contain provisions (1) prohibiting the contractor from subcontracting any part of the work he is obligated to perform under the contract, except as authorized by the Commission; and (2) obligating the contractor (A) to make such reports pertaining to activities under the contract to the Commission as the Commission may require, (B) to submit to inspection by employees of the Commission of all such activities, and (C) to comply with all safety and security regulations which may be prescribed by the Commission. Any contract made under the provisions of this subsection may be made without regard to the provisions of section 6101 of title 41, upon certification by the Commission that such action is necessary in the interest of the common defense and security, or upon a showing by the Commission that advertising is not reasonably practicable. Partial and advance payments may be made under such contracts.

#### (c) Operation of other facilities
* Special nuclear material may be produced in the facilities which under this section are not required to be owned by the Commission.

### §2062. Irradiation of materials
* The Commission and persons lawfully producing or utilizing special nuclear material are authorized to expose materials of any kind to the radiation incident to the processes of producing or utilizing special nuclear material.

### §2063. Acquisition of production facilities
* The Commission is authorized to purchase any interest in facilities for the production of special nuclear materials, or in real property on which such facilities are located, without regard to the provisions of section 6101 of title 41 upon certification by the Commission that such action is necessary in the interest of the common defense and security, or upon a showing by the Commission that advertising is not reasonably practicable. Partial and advance payments may be made under contracts for such purposes. The Commission is further authorized to requisition, condemn, or otherwise acquire any interest in such production facilities, or to condemn or otherwise acquire such real property, and just compensation shall be made therefor.

### §2064. Disposition of energy; regulation on sale
* If energy is produced at production facilities of the Commission or is produced in experimental utilization facilities of the Commission, such energy may be used by the Commission, or transferred to other Government agencies, or sold to publicly, cooperatively, or privately owned utilities or users at reasonable and nondiscriminatory prices. If the energy produced is electric energy, the price shall be subject to regulation by the appropriate agency having jurisdiction. In contracting for the disposal of such energy, the Commission shall give preference and priority to public bodies and cooperatives or to privately owned utilities providing electric utility services to high cost areas not being served by public bodies or cooperatives. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize the Commission to engage in the sale or distribution of energy for commercial use except such energy as may be produced by the Commission incident to the operation of research and development facilities of the Commission, or of production facilities of the Commission.

### §2065. Improving the reliability of domestic medical isotope supply
#### (a) Medical isotope development projects
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall carry out a technology-neutral program—

    * (A) to evaluate and support projects for the production in the United States, without the use of highly enriched uranium, of significant quantities of molybdenum-99 for medical uses;

    * (B) to be carried out in cooperation with non-Federal entities; and

    * (C) the costs of which shall be shared in accordance with section 16352 of this title.

* #### (2) Criteria
  * Projects shall be evaluated against the following primary criteria:

    * (A) The length of time necessary for the proposed project to begin production of molybdenum-99 for medical uses within the United States.

    * (B) The capability of the proposed project to produce a significant percentage of United States demand for molybdenum-99 for medical uses.

    * (C) The capability of the proposed project to produce molybdenum-99 in a cost-effective manner.

    * (D) The cost of the proposed project.

* #### (3) Exemption
  * An existing reactor in the United States fueled with highly enriched uranium shall not be disqualified from the program if the Secretary determines that—

    * (A) there is no alternative nuclear reactor fuel, enriched in the isotope U–235 to less than 20 percent, that can be used in that reactor;

    * (B) the reactor operator has provided assurances that, whenever an alternative nuclear reactor fuel, enriched in the isotope U–235 to less than 20 percent, can be used in that reactor, it will use that alternative in lieu of highly enriched uranium; and

    * (C) the reactor operator has provided a current report on the status of its efforts to convert the reactor to an alternative nuclear reactor fuel enriched in the isotope U–235 to less than 20 percent, and an anticipated schedule for completion of conversion.

* #### (4) Public participation and review
  * The Secretary shall—

    * (A) develop a program plan and annually update the program plan through public workshops; and

    * (B) use the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee to conduct annual reviews of the progress made in achieving the program goals and make recommendations to improve program effectiveness.
