#### (b) Reimbursement
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary of Energy shall, subject to paragraph (2), reimburse at least annually a licensee described in subsection (a) for such portion of the costs described in such subsection as are—

    * (A) determined by the Secretary to be attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States; and

    * (B) either—

      * (i) incurred by such licensee not later than December 31, 2007; or

      * (ii) incurred by a licensee after December 31, 2007, in accordance with a plan for subsequent decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action approved by the Secretary.

* #### (2) Amount
  * #### (A) To individual active site uranium licensees
    * The amount of reimbursement paid to any licensee under paragraph (1) shall be determined by the Secretary in accordance with regulations issued pursuant to section 2296a–1 of this title and, for uranium mill tailings only, shall not exceed an amount equal to $6.25 multiplied by the dry short tons of byproduct material located on October 24, 1992, at the site of the activities of such licensee described in subsection (a), and generated as an incident of sales to the United States.

  * #### (B) To all active site uranium licensees
    * Payments made under paragraph (1) to active site uranium licensees shall not in the aggregate exceed $350,000,000.

  * #### (C) To thorium licensees
    * Payments made under paragraph (1) to the licensee of the active thorium site shall not exceed $365,000,000, and may only be made for off-site disposal. Such payments shall not exceed the following amounts:

      * (i) $90,000,000 in fiscal year 2002.

      * The Secretary shall determine as of December 31, 2008, whether the amount authorized to be appropriated pursuant to section 2296a–2 of this title, when considered with the $6.25 per dry short ton limit on reimbursement, exceeds the amount reimbursable to the licensees under subsection (b)(2).

    * #### (ii) In the event of excess
      * If the Secretary determines under clause (i) that there is an excess, the Secretary may allow reimbursement in excess of $6.25 per dry short ton on a prorated basis at such sites where the costs reimbursable under subsection (b)(1) exceed the $6.25 per dry short ton limitation described in paragraph (2) of such subsection.

* #### (3) Byproduct location
  * Notwithstanding the requirement of paragraph (2)(A) that byproduct material be located at the site on October 24, 1992, byproduct material moved from the site of the Edgemont Mill to a disposal site as the result of the decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action of such mill shall be eligible for reimbursement to the extent eligible under paragraph (1).

### §2296a–1. Regulations
* Within 180 days of October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall issue regulations governing reimbursement under section 2296a of this title.

* Funds described in subsection (a) shall be provided from the Fund established under section 2297g of this title.

### §2296a–3. Definitions
* For purposes of this part:

  * (1) The term "active uranium or thorium processing site" means—

    * (A) any uranium or thorium processing site, including the mill, containing byproduct material for which a license (issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its predecessor agency under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], or by a State as permitted under section 274 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 2021)) for the production at such site of any uranium or thorium derived from ore—

      * (i) was in effect on January 1, 1978;

      * (ii) was issued or renewed after January 1, 1978; or

      * (iii) for which an application for renewal or issuance was pending on, or after January 1, 1978; and

      * (ii) contaminated with residual byproduct material;


  * (2) The term "byproduct material" has the meaning given such term in section 11 e. (2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, (42 U.S.C. 2014(e)(2)); and

  * (3) The term "decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action" means work performed prior to or subsequent to October 24, 1992, which is necessary to comply with all applicable requirements of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 7901 et seq.), or where appropriate, with requirements established by a State that is a party to a discontinuance agreement under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).
