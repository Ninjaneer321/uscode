### SUBCHAPTER XI—CONTROL OF INFORMATION

### §2161. Policy of Commission
* It shall be the policy of the Commission to control the dissemination and declassification of Restricted Data in such a manner as to assure the common defense and security. Consistent with such policy, the Commission shall be guided by the following principles:

* (a) Until effective and enforceable international safeguards against the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes have been established by an international arrangement, there shall be no exchange of Restricted Data with other nations except as authorized by section 2164 of this title; and

* (b) The dissemination of scientific and technical information relating to atomic energy should be permitted and encouraged so as to provide that free interchange of ideas and criticism which is essential to scientific and industrial progress and public understanding and to enlarge the fund of technical information.

### §2162. Classification and declassification of Restricted Data
#### (a) Periodic determination
* The Commission shall from time to time determine the data, within the definition of Restricted Data, which can be published without undue risk to the common defense and security and shall thereupon cause such data to be declassified and removed from the category of Restricted Data.

#### (b) Continuous review
* The Commission shall maintain a continuous review of Restricted Data and of any Classification Guides issued for the guidance of those in the atomic energy program with respect to the areas of Restricted Data which have been declassified in order to determine which information may be declassified and removed from the category of Restricted Data without undue risk to the common defense and security.

#### (c) Joint determination on atomic weapons; Presidential determination on disagreement
* In the case of Restricted Data which the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly determine to relate primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons, the determination that such data may be published without constituting an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security shall be made by the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly, and if the Commission and the Department of Defense do not agree, the determination shall be made by the President.

#### (d) Removal from Restricted Data category
* (1) The Commission shall remove from the Restricted Data category such data as the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly determine relates primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons and which the Commission and Department of Defense jointly determine can be adequately safeguarded as defense information: _Provided, however_, That no such data so removed from the Restricted Data category shall be transmitted or otherwise made available to any nation or regional defense organization, while such data remains defense information, except pursuant to an agreement for cooperation entered into in accordance with subsection (b) or (d) of section 2164 of this title.

* (2) The Commission may restore to the Restricted Data category any information related to the design of nuclear weapons removed under paragraph (1) if the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly determine that—

  * (A) the programmatic requirements that caused the information to be removed from the Restricted Data category are no longer applicable or have diminished;

  * (B) the information would be more appropriately protected as Restricted Data; and

  * (C) restoring the information to the Restricted Data category is in the interest of national security.


* (3) In carrying out paragraph (2), information related to the design of nuclear weapons shall be restored to the Restricted Data category in accordance with regulations prescribed for purposes of such paragraph.

#### (e) Joint determination on atomic energy programs
* (1) The Commission shall remove from the Restricted Data category such information concerning the atomic energy programs of other nations as the Commission and the Director of National Intelligence jointly determine to be necessary to carry out the provisions of section 102(d) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, and can be adequately safeguarded as defense information.

* (2) The Commission may restore to the Restricted Data category any information concerning atomic energy programs of other nations removed under paragraph (1) if the Commission and the Director of National Intelligence jointly determine that—

  * (A) the programmatic requirements that caused the information to be removed from the Restricted Data category are no longer applicable or have diminished;

  * (B) the information would be more appropriately protected as Restricted Data; and

  * (C) restoring the information to the Restricted Data category is in the interest of national security.


* (3) In carrying out paragraph (2), information concerning atomic energy programs of other nations shall be restored to the Restricted Data category in accordance with regulations prescribed for purposes of such paragraph.

### §2163. Access to Restricted Data
* The Commission may authorize any of its employees, or employees of any contractor, prospective contractor, licensee or prospective licensee of the Commission or any other person authorized access to Restricted Data by the Commission under section 2165(b) and (c) of this title to permit any employee of an agency of the Department of Defense or of its contractors, or any member of the Armed Forces to have access to Restricted Data required in the performance of his duties and so certified by the head of the appropriate agency of the Department of Defense or his designee: _Provided, however_, That the head of the appropriate agency of the Department of Defense or his designee has determined, in accordance with the established personnel security procedures and standards of such agency, that permitting the member or employee to have access to such Restricted Data will not endanger the common defense and security: _And provided further_, That the Secretary of Defense finds that the established personnel and other security procedures and standards of such agency are adequate and in reasonable conformity to the standards established by the Commission under section 2165 of this title.
