### §8373. Conservation in Federal facilities, contracts, and financial assistance programs
#### (a) Federal facilities
* (1) Each Federal agency owning or operating any electric powerplant shall comply with any prohibition, term, condition, or other substantial or procedural requirement under this chapter, to the same extent as would be the case if such powerplant were owned or operated by a nongovernmental person.

* (2) The President may, by order, exempt from the application of paragraph (1) any powerplant owned or operated by any Federal agency, if the President determines that—

  * (A) such use is in the paramount interest of the United States and that the powerplant involved is a component of or is used solely in connection with any weaponry, equipment, aircraft, vessels, vehicles or other classes or categories of property which—

    * (i) are owned or operated by the Armed Forces of the United States (including the Coast Guard) or by the National Guard of any State; and

    * (ii) are uniquely military in nature; or


  * (B) there is a lack of appropriation for such use but only if the President specifically requested such appropriations as a part of the budgetary process and the Congress failed to make available such requested appropriation.


* Such order shall not take effect until 60 days after a copy of such order has been transmitted to each House of the Congress. The President shall review each such determination every 2 years and submit a report to the Congress on the results of such review.

#### (b) Federal contracts and financial assistance
* (1) In order to implement the purposes of this chapter, the President shall, not later than 30 days after the effective date of this chapter, issue an order—

  * (A) requiring each Federal agency which is authorized to extend Federal assistance by way of grant, loan, contract, or other form of financial assistance, to promptly effectuate the purposes of this chapter relating to the conservation of petroleum and natural gas, by rule, in such contracting or assistance activities within 180 days after issuance of such order, and

  * (B) setting forth procedures, sanctions, penalties, and such other provisions as the President determines necessary to carry out such requirement effectively, including a requirement that each agency annually transmit to the President, and make available to the public, a report on the actions taken and to be taken to implement such order.


* (2) The President may exempt by order any specific grant, loan, contract, or other form of financial assistance from all or part of the provisions of this subsection if he determines such exemption is in the national interest. The President shall notify the Congress in writing of such exemption at least 60 days before it is effective.

* (3) The President or any Federal agency may not use the authority granted under paragraph (1) to require compliance, including the use of coal, by any person or facility with any prohibition under other sections of this chapter if such person or facility has been specifically determined by the Secretary as subject to such prohibition or has been exempted from the application of such prohibition.

### §8374. Emergency authorities
#### (a) Coal allocation authority
* (1) If the President—

  * (A) declares a severe energy supply interruption, as defined in section 6202(8) of this title, or

  * (B) finds, and publishes such finding, that a national or regional fuel supply shortage exists or may exist which the President determines—

    * (i) is, or is likely to be, of significant scope and duration, and of an emergency nature;

    * (ii) causes, or may cause, major adverse impact on public health, safety, or welfare or on the economy; and

    * (iii) results, or is likely to result, from an interruption in the supply of coal or from sabotage, or an act of God;


* the President may, by order, allocate coal (and require the transportation thereof) for the use of any electric powerplant or major fuel-burning installation, in accordance with such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure reliability of electric service or prevent unemployment, or protect public health, safety, or welfare.

* (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term "coal" means anthracite and bituminous coal and lignite (but does not mean any fuel derivative thereof).

#### (b) Emergency prohibition on use of natural gas or petroleum
* If the President declares a severe energy supply interruption, as defined in section 6202(8) of this title, the President may, by order, prohibit any electric powerplant or major fuel-burning installation from using natural gas or petroleum, or both, as a primary energy source for the duration of such interruption. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any suspension of emission limitations or other requirements of applicable implementation plans, as defined in section 7410(d) of this title, required by such prohibition shall be issued only in accordance with section 7410(f) of this title.

#### (c) Emergency stays
* The President may, by order, stay the application of any provision of this chapter, or any rule or order thereunder, applicable to any new or existing electric powerplant, if the President finds, and publishes such finding, that an emergency exists, due to national, regional, or systemwide shortages of coal or other alternate fuels, or disruption of transportation facilities, which emergency is likely to affect reliability of service of any such electric powerplant.

#### (d) Duration of emergency orders
* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), any order issued by the President under this section shall not be effective for longer than the duration of the interruption or emergency, or 90 days, whichever is less.

* (2) Any such order may be extended by a subsequent order which the President shall transmit to the Congress in accordance with section 6421 of this title. Such order shall be subject to congressional review pursuant to such section.

* (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the effectiveness of any order issued under this section shall not terminate under this subsection during the 15-calendar-day period during which any such subsequent order described in paragraph (2) is subject to congressional review under section 6421 of this title.

* (4) For purposes of this subsection, the provisions of this subsection supersede the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 34 of title 50.

#### (e) Delegation of authority prohibited
* The authority of the President to issue any order under this section may not be delegated. This subsection shall not be construed to prevent the President from directing any Federal agency to issue rules or regulations or take such other action, consistent with this section, in the implementation of such order.

#### (f) Publication and reports to Congress of orders
* Any order issued under this section shall be published in the Federal Register. To the greatest extent practicable, the President shall, before issuing any order under this section, but in no event later than 5 days after issuing such order, report to the Congress of his intention to issue such order and state his reasons therefor.
