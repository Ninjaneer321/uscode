### PART G—COORDINATION WITH OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW

### §8471. Effect on environmental requirements
#### (a) Compliance with applicable environmental requirements

#### (b) Local environmental requirements
* In the case of any new or existing facility—

  * (1) which is subject to any prohibition under this chapter, and

  * (2) which is also subject to any requirement of any local environmental requirement which may be stricter than any Federal or State environmental requirement,


* the existence of such local requirement shall not be construed to affect the validity or applicability of such prohibition to such facility, except to the extent provided under section 8322(b) or section 8352(b) of this title; and the existence of such prohibition shall not be construed to preempt such local requirement with respect to that facility.

### §8472. Effect of orders under section 792 of title 15
#### (a) Effect of construction orders

#### (b) Effect of prohibition orders
* The provisions of subchapters II and III shall not apply to any powerplant or installation for which an order issued pursuant to section 792(a) of title 15 before the effective date of this chapter is pending or final or which, on review, was held unlawful and set aside on the merits; except that any installation issued such an order under such section 792(a) which is pending on the effective date of this chapter may elect to be covered by subchapter II or III (as the case may be) rather than such section 792. Such an election shall be irrevocable and shall be made in such form and manner as the Secretary shall, within 90 days after November 9, 1978, prescribe. Such an election shall be made not later than 60 days after the date on which the Secretary prescribes the form and manner of making such election.

* Except as provided in the preceding provisions of this section, any determination of what constitutes or does not constitute a major Federal action shall be made under section 4332 of this title.
