### PART E—STUDIES

### §8451. National coal policy study
#### (a) Study
* The President, acting through the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall make a full and complete investigation and study of the alternative national uses of coal available in the United States to meet the Nation's energy requirements consistent with national policies for the protection and enhancement of the quality of the environment and for economic recovery and full employment. In particular the study should identify and evaluate—

  * (1) current and prospective coal requirements of the United States;

  * (2) current and prospective voluntary and mandatory energy conservation measures and their potential for reduction of the United States coal requirements;

  * (3) current and prospective coal resource production, transportation, conversion, and utilization requirements;

  * (4) the extent and adequacy of coal research, development, and demonstration programs being carried out by Federal, State, local, and nongovernmental entities (including financial resources, manpower, and statutory authority);

  * (5) programs for the development of coal mining technologies which increase coal production and utilization while protecting the health and safety of coal miners;

  * (6) alternative strategies for meeting anticipated United States coal requirements, consistent with achieving other national goals, including national security and environmental protection;

  * (7) existing and prospective governmental policies and laws affecting the coal industry with the view of determining what, if any, changes in and implementation of such policies and laws may be advisable in order to consolidate, coordinate, and provide an effective and equitable national energy policy consistent with other national policies; and

  * (8) the most efficient use of the Nation's coal resources considering economic (including capital and consumer costs, and balance of payments), social (including employment), environmental, technological, national defense, and other aspects.

#### (b) Report
* Within 18 months after the effective date of this chapter, the President shall submit to the Congress a report with respect to the studies and investigations, together with findings and recommendations in order that the Congress may have such information in a timely fashion. Such report shall include the President's determinations and recommendations with respect to—

  * (1) the Nation's projected coal needs nationally and regionally, for the next 2 decades with particular reference to electric power;

  * (2) the coal resources available or which must be developed to meet those needs, including, as applicable, the programs for research, development, and demonstration necessary to provide technological advances which may greatly enhance the Nation's ability to efficiently and economically utilize its fuel resources, consistent with applicable environmental requirements;

  * (3) the air, water, and other pollution created by coal requirements, including any programs to overcome promptly and efficiently any technological or economic barriers to the elimination of such pollution;

  * (4) the existing policies and programs of the Federal Government and of State and local governments, which have any significant impact on the availability, production or efficient and economic utilization of coal resources and on the ability to meet the Nation's energy needs and environmental requirements; and

  * (5) the adequacy of various transportation systems, including roads, railroads, and waterways to meet projected increases in coal production and utilization.


* Before submitting a report to the Congress under subsection (b) of this section, the President shall publish in the Federal Register a notice and summary of the proposed report, make copies of such report available, and accord interested persons an opportunity (of not less than 90 days' duration) to present written comments; and shall make such modifications of such report as he may consider appropriate on the basis of such comments.

#### (c) Authorization of appropriations
* There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for allocation between the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency for fiscal years 1979 and 1980, not to exceed $18,000,000, for use in carrying out the purposes of this section.

### §8453. Impact on employees
#### (a) Evaluation
* The Secretary shall conduct continuing evaluations of potential loss or shifts of employment which may result from any prohibition under this chapter, including, if appropriate, investigating threatened plant closures or reductions in employment allegedly resulting from such prohibition. The results of such evaluations and each investigation shall promptly be made available to the public.

#### (b) Investigation and hearings
* On a written request filed with the Secretary by or on behalf of any employee who is discharged or laid off, threatened with discharge or layoff, or otherwise discriminated against, by any person because of the alleged effects of any such prohibition, the Secretary shall investigate the matter and, at the request of any party, shall hold public hearings, after not less than 30 days notice, at which the Secretary shall require the parties, including any employer involved, to present information on the actual or potential effect of such prohibition on employment and on any alleged employee discharge, layoff, or other discrimination relating to prohibitions and the detailed reasons or justification therefor. At the completion of such investigation, the Secretary shall make findings of fact as to the effect of such prohibition on employment and on the alleged employee discharge, layoff, or discrimination and shall make such recommendations as he deems appropriate. Such report, findings, and recommendations shall be available to the public. The Secretary of Labor shall participate in each such investigation.

#### (c) Rule of construction
* Nothing in this section shall be construed to require or authorize the Secretary to modify or withdraw any prohibition under this chapter.

### §8454. Study of compliance problem of small electric utility systems
#### (a) Study
* The Secretary shall conduct a study of the problems of compliance with this chapter experienced by those electric utility systems which have a total system generating capacity of less than 2,000 megawatts. The Secretary shall report his findings and his recommendations to the Congress not later than 2 years after the effective date of this chapter.

#### (b) Authorization of appropriations
* There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for the fiscal year 1979 not to exceed $500,000 to carry out the provisions of this section.

### §8456. Socioeconomic impacts of increased coal production and other energy development
#### (a) Committee
* There is hereby established an interagency committee composed of the heads of the Departments of Energy, Commerce, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Farmers' Home Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and such other Federal agencies as the Secretary shall designate. In carrying out its functions the committee shall consult with the National Governors' Conference and interested persons, organizations, and entities. The chairman of the committee shall be designated by the President. The committee shall terminate 90 days after the submission of its report under subsection (c).

#### (b) Functions of committee
* It is the function of the committee to conduct a study of the socioeconomic impacts of expanded coal production and rapid energy development in general, on States, including local communities, and on the public, including the adequacy of housing and public, recreational, and cultural facilities for coal miners and their families and the effect of any Federal or State laws or regulations on providing such housing and facilities. The committee shall gather data and information on—
