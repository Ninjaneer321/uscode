### PART A—RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD

### §17021. Biomass-based diesel and biodiesel labeling
#### (a) In general
* Each retail diesel fuel pump shall be labeled in a manner that informs consumers of the percent of biomass-based diesel or biodiesel that is contained in the biomass-based diesel blend or biodiesel blend that is offered for sale, as determined by the Federal Trade Commission.

#### (b) Labeling requirements
* Not later than 180 days after December 19, 2007, the Federal Trade Commission shall promulgate biodiesel labeling requirements as follows:

  * (1) Biomass-based diesel blends or biodiesel blends that contain less than or equal to 5 percent biomass-based diesel or biodiesel by volume and that meet ASTM D975 diesel specifications shall not require any additional labels.

  * (2) Biomass-based diesel blends or biodiesel blends that contain more than 5 percent biomass-based diesel or biodiesel by volume but not more than 20 percent by volume shall be labeled "contains biomass-based diesel or biodiesel in quantities between 5 percent and 20 percent".

  * (3) Biomass-based diesel or biodiesel blends that contain more than 20 percent biomass based or biodiesel by volume shall be labeled "contains more than 20 percent biomass-based diesel or biodiesel".

#### (c) Definitions
* In this section:

* #### (1) ASTM
  * The term "ASTM" means the American Society of Testing and Materials.

* #### (2) Biomass-based diesel
  * The term "biomass-based diesel" means biodiesel as defined in section 13220(f) of this title.

* #### (3) Biodiesel
  * The term "biodiesel" means the monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from plant or animal matter that meet—

    * (A) the registration requirements for fuels and fuel additives under this section; and

    * (B) the requirements of ASTM standard D6751.

* #### (4) Biomass-based diesel and biodiesel blends
  * The terms "biomass-based diesel blend" and "biodiesel blend" means a blend of "biomass-based diesel" or "biodiesel" fuel that is blended with petroleum-based diesel fuel.

### §17022. Grants for production of advanced biofuels
#### (a) In general
* The Secretary of Energy shall establish a grant program to encourage the production of advanced biofuels.

#### (b) Requirements and priority
* In making grants under this section, the Secretary—

  * (1) shall make awards to the proposals for advanced biofuels with the greatest reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to the comparable motor vehicle fuel lifecycle emissions during calendar year 2005; and

  * (2) shall not make an award to a project that does not achieve at least an 80 percent reduction in such lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.

#### (c) Authorization of appropriations
* There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $500,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2015, except that the amount authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section not appropriated as of October 2, 2013, shall be reduced by $6,000,000.
