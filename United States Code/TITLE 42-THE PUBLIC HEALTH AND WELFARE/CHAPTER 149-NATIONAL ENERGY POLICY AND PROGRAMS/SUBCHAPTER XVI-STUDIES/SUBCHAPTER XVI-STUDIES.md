### SUBCHAPTER XVI—STUDIES

### §16521. Report on energy integration with Latin America
* The Secretary shall submit an annual report to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the United States House of Representatives and to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate concerning the status of energy export development in Latin America and efforts by the Secretary and other departments and agencies of the United States to promote energy integration with Latin America. The report shall contain a detailed analysis of the status of energy export development in Mexico and a description of all significant efforts by the Secretary and other departments and agencies to promote a constructive relationship with Mexico regarding the development of that nation's energy capacity. In particular this report shall outline efforts the Secretary and other departments and agencies have made to ensure that regulatory approval and oversight of United States/Mexico border projects that result in the expansion of Mexican energy capacity are effectively coordinated across departments and with the Mexican government.

### §16522. Low-volume gas reservoir study
#### (a) Study
* The Secretary shall make a grant to an organization of oil and gas producing States, specifically those containing significant numbers of marginal oil and natural gas wells, for conducting an annual study of low-volume natural gas reservoirs. Such organization shall work with the State geologist of each State being studied.

#### (b) Contents
* The studies under this section shall—

  * (1) determine the status and location of marginal wells and gas reservoirs;

  * (2) gather the production information of these marginal wells and reservoirs;

  * (3) estimate the remaining producible reserves based on variable pipeline pressures;

  * (4) locate low-pressure gathering facilities and pipelines;

  * (5) recommend incentives which will enable the continued production of these resources;

  * (6) produce maps and literature to disseminate to States to promote conservation of natural gas reserves; and

  * (7) evaluate the amount of natural gas that is being wasted through the practice of venting or flaring of natural gas produced in association with crude oil well production.

#### (c) Data analysis
* Data development and analysis under this section shall be performed by an institution of higher education with GIS capabilities. If the organization receiving the grant under subsection (a) does not have GIS capabilities, such organization shall contract with one or more entities with—

  * (1) technological capabilities and resources to perform advanced image processing, GIS programming, and data analysis; and

  * (2) the ability to—

    * (A) process remotely sensed imagery with high spatial resolution;

    * (B) deploy global positioning systems;

    * (C) process and synthesize existing, variable-format gas well, pipeline, gathering facility, and reservoir data;

    * (D) create and query GIS databases with infrastructure location and attribute information;

    * (E) write computer programs to customize relevant GIS software;

    * (F) generate maps, charts, and graphs which summarize findings from data research for presentation to different audiences; and

    * (G) deliver data in a variety of formats, including Internet Map Server for query and display, desktop computer display, and access through handheld personal digital assistants.

#### (d) Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for carrying out this section—

  * (1) $1,500,000 for fiscal year 2006; and

  * (2) $450,000 for each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2010.

#### (e) Definitions
* For purposes of this section, the term "GIS" means geographic information systems technology that facilitates the organization and management of data with a geographic component.

### §16523. Alaska natural gas pipeline
* Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, and every 180 days thereafter until the Alaska natural gas pipeline commences operation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall submit to Congress a report describing—

  * (1) the progress made in licensing and constructing the pipeline; and

  * (2) any issue impeding that progress.

### §16524. Study on the benefits of economic dispatch
#### (a) Study
* The Secretary, in coordination and consultation with the States, shall conduct a study on—

  * (1) the procedures currently used by electric utilities to perform economic dispatch;

  * (2) identifying possible revisions to those procedures to improve the ability of nonutility generation resources to offer their output for sale for the purpose of inclusion in economic dispatch; and

  * (3) the potential benefits to residential, commercial, and industrial electricity consumers nationally and in each state if economic dispatch procedures were revised to improve the ability of nonutility generation resources to offer their output for inclusion in economic dispatch.

#### (b) Definition
* The term "economic dispatch" when used in this section means the operation of generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost to reliably serve consumers, recognizing any operational limits of generation and transmission facilities.

#### (c) Report to Congress and the States
* Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005, and on a yearly basis following, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress and the States on the results of the study conducted under subsection (a), including recommendations to Congress and the States for any suggested legislative or regulatory changes.
