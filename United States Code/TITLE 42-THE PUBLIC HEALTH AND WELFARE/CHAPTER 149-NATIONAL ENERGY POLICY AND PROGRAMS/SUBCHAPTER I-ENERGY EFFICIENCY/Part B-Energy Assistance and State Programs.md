### §15821. Energy efficient appliance rebate programs
#### (a) Definitions
* In this section:

* #### (1) Eligible State
  * The term "eligible State" means a State that meets the requirements of subsection (b).

* #### (2) Energy Star program
  * The term "Energy Star program" means the program established by section 6294a of this title.

* #### (3) Residential Energy Star product
  * The term "residential Energy Star product" means a product for a residence that is rated for energy efficiency under the Energy Star program.

* #### (4) State energy office
  * The term "State energy office" means the State agency responsible for developing State energy conservation plans under section 6322 of this title.

* #### (5) State program
  * The term "State program" means a State energy efficient appliance rebate program described in subsection (b)(1).

#### (b) Eligible States
* A State shall be eligible to receive an allocation under subsection (c) if the State—

  * (1) establishes (or has established) a State energy efficient appliance rebate program to provide rebates to residential consumers for the purchase of residential Energy Star products, or products with improved energy efficiency in cold climates, to replace used appliances of the same type;

  * (2) submits an application for the allocation at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the Secretary may require; and

  * (3) provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the State will use the allocation to supplement, but not supplant, funds made available to carry out the State program.

#### (c) Amount of allocations
* #### (1) In general
  * Subject to paragraph (2), for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate to the State energy office of each eligible State to carry out subsection (d) an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the amount made available under subsection (f) for the fiscal year by the ratio that the population of the State in the most recent calendar year for which data are available bears to the total population of all eligible States in that calendar year.

* #### (2) Minimum allocations
  * For each fiscal year, the amounts allocated under this subsection shall be adjusted proportionately so that no eligible State is allocated a sum that is less than an amount determined by the Secretary.

#### (d) Use of allocated funds
* The allocation to a State energy office under subsection (c) may be used to pay up to 50 percent of the cost of establishing and carrying out a State program.

#### (e) Issuance of rebates
* Rebates may be provided to residential consumers that meet the requirements of the State program. The amount of a rebate shall be determined by the State energy office, taking into consideration—

  * (1) the amount of the allocation to the State energy office under subsection (c);

  * (2) the amount of any Federal or State tax incentive available for the purchase of the residential Energy Star product or product with improved energy efficiency in a cold climate; and

  * (3) the difference between the cost of the residential Energy Star product or product with improved energy efficiency in a cold climate and the cost of an appliance that is not a residential Energy Star product or product with improved energy efficiency in a cold climate, but is of the same type as, and is the nearest capacity, performance, and other relevant characteristics (as determined by the State energy office) to, the residential Energy Star product or product with improved energy efficiency in a cold climate.

#### (f) Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section $50,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.

### §15822. Energy efficient public buildings
#### (a) Grants
* The Secretary may make grants to the State agency responsible for developing State energy conservation plans under section 6322 of this title, or, if no such agency exists, a State agency designated by the Governor of the State, to assist units of local government in the State in improving the energy efficiency of public buildings and facilities—

  * (1) through construction of new energy efficient public buildings that use at least 30 percent less energy than a comparable public building constructed in compliance with standards prescribed in the most recent version of the International Energy Conservation Code, or a similar State code intended to achieve substantially equivalent efficiency levels; or

  * (2) through renovation of existing public buildings to achieve reductions in energy use of at least 30 percent as compared to the baseline energy use in such buildings prior to renovation, assuming a 3-year, weather-normalized average for calculating such baseline.

#### (b) Administration
* State energy offices receiving grants under this section shall—

  * (1) maintain such records and evidence of compliance as the Secretary may require; and

  * (2) develop and distribute information and materials and conduct programs to provide technical services and assistance to encourage planning, financing, and design of energy efficient public buildings by units of local government.

#### (c) Authorization of appropriations
* For the purposes of this section, there are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary $30,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2010. Not more than 10 percent of appropriated funds shall be used for administration.

### §15823. Low income community energy efficiency pilot program
#### (a) Grants
* The Secretary is authorized to make grants to units of local government, private, non-profit community development organizations, and Indian tribe economic development entities to improve energy efficiency; identify and develop alternative, renewable, and distributed energy supplies; and increase energy conservation in low income rural and urban communities.

#### (b) Purpose of grants
* The Secretary may make grants on a competitive basis for—

  * (1) investments that develop alternative, renewable, and distributed energy supplies;

  * (2) energy efficiency projects and energy conservation programs;

  * (3) studies and other activities that improve energy efficiency in low income rural and urban communities;

  * (4) planning and development assistance for increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and facilities; and

  * (5) technical and financial assistance to local government and private entities on developing new renewable and distributed sources of power or combined heat and power generation.

#### (c) Definition
* For purposes of this section, the term "Indian tribe" means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaskan Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), that is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.
