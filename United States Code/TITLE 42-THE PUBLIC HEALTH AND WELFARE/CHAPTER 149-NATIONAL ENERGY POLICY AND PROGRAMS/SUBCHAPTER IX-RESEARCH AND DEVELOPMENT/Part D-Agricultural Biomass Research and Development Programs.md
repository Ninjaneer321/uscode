    * (B) not later than 3 years after August 8, 2005.

* #### (4) Reverse auction procedure
  * #### (A) In general
    * On initiation of the first reverse auction, and each year thereafter until the earlier of the first year of annual production in the United States of 1,000,000,000 gallons of cellulosic biofuels, as determined by the Secretary, or 10 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall conduct a reverse auction at which—
