### PART A—HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS

### §12741. Authority
* The Secretary is authorized to make funds available to participating jurisdictions for investment to increase the number of families served with decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing and expand the long-term supply of affordable housing in accordance with provisions of this part.

### §12742. Eligible uses of investment
#### (a) Housing uses
* #### (1) In general
  * Funds made available under this part may be used by participating jurisdictions to provide incentives to develop and support affordable rental housing and homeownership affordability through the acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of affordable housing, including real property acquisition, site improvement, conversion, demolition, and other expenses, including financing costs, relocation expenses of any displaced persons, families, businesses, or organizations, to provide for the payment of reasonable administrative and planning costs, to provide for the payment of operating expenses of community housing development organizations, and to provide tenant-based rental assistance. For the purpose of this part, the term "affordable housing" includes permanent housing for disabled homeless persons, transitional housing, and single room occupancy housing.

* #### (2) Preference to rehabilitation
  * A participating jurisdiction shall give preference to rehabilitation of substandard housing unless the jurisdiction determines that—

    * (A) such rehabilitation is not the most cost effective way to meet the jurisdiction's need to expand the supply of affordable housing; and

    * (B) the jurisdiction's housing needs cannot be met through rehabilitation of the available stock.


* The Secretary shall not restrict a participating jurisdiction's choice of rehabilitation, substantial rehabilitation, new construction, reconstruction, acquisition, or other eligible housing use unless such restriction is explicitly authorized under section 12753(2) of this title.

* #### (3) Tenant-based rental assistance
  * #### (A) In general
    * A participating jurisdiction may use funds provided under this part for tenant-based rental assistance only if—

      * (i) the jurisdiction certifies that the use of funds under this part for tenant-based rental assistance is an essential element of the jurisdiction's annual housing strategy for expanding the supply, affordability, and availability of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, and specifies the local market conditions that lead to the choice of this option; and

      * (ii) the tenant-based rental assistance is provided in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably related to preference rules established under section 1437d(c)(4)(A) of this title.

  * #### (B) Fair share not affected
    * A jurisdiction's section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] fair share allocation shall be unaffected by the use of assistance under this subchapter.

  * #### (C) 24-month contracts
    * Rental assistance contracts made available with assistance under this subchapter shall be for not more than 24 months, except that assistance to a family may be renewed.

  * #### (D) Use of section 1437f assistance
    * In any case where assistance under section 1437f of this title becomes available to a participating jurisdiction, recipients of rental assistance under this subchapter shall qualify for tenant selection preferences to the same extent as when they received the rental assistance under this subchapter. A rental assistance program under this subchapter shall meet minimum criteria prescribed by the Secretary, such as housing quality standards and standards regarding the reasonableness of the rent.

  * #### (E) Security deposit assistance
    * A jurisdiction using funds provided under this part for tenant-based rental assistance may use such funds to provide loans or grants to very low- and low-income families for security deposits for rental of dwelling units. Assistance under this subparagraph does not preclude assistance under any other provision of this paragraph.

* #### (4) Redesignated (3)
* #### (5) Lead-based paint hazards
  * A participating jurisdiction may use funds provided under this part for the evaluation and reduction of lead-based paint hazards, as defined in section 4851b of this title.

#### (b) Investments
* Participating jurisdictions shall have discretion to invest funds made available under this part as equity investments, interest-bearing loans or advances, noninterest-bearing loans or advances, interest subsidies or other forms of assistance that the Secretary has determined to be consistent with the purposes of this subchapter. Each participating jurisdiction shall have the right to establish the terms of assistance.

#### (c) Administrative costs
* In each fiscal year, each participating jurisdiction may use not more than 10 percent of the funds made available under this part to the jurisdiction for such year for any administrative and planning costs of the jurisdiction in carrying out this part, including the costs of the salaries of persons engaged in administering and managing activities assisted with funds made available under this part.

#### (d) Prohibited uses
* Funds made available under this part may not be used to—

  * (1) defray any administrative cost of a participating jurisdiction that exceed the amount specified under subsection (c),

  * (2) provide tenant-based rental assistance for the special purposes of the existing section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] program, including replacing public housing that is demolished or disposed of, preserving federally assisted housing, assisting in the disposition of housing owned or held by the Secretary, preventing displacement from rental rehabilitation projects, or extending or renewing tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title,

#### (e) Cost limits
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall establish limits on the amount of funds under this part that may be invested on a per unit basis. For multifamily housing, such limits shall not be less than the per unit dollar amount limitations set forth in section 1715l(d)(3)(ii) of title 12, as such limitations may be adjusted in accordance therewith, except that for purposes of this subsection the Secretary shall, by regulation, increase the per unit dollar amount limitations in any geographical area by an amount, not to exceed 140 percent, that equals the amount by which the costs of multifamily housing construction in the area exceed the national average of such costs. The limits shall be established on a market-by-market basis, with adjustments made for number of bedrooms, and shall reflect the actual cost of new construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of housing that meets applicable State and local housing and building codes and the cost of land, including necessary site improvements. Adjustments shall be made annually to reflect inflation. Separate limits may be set for different eligible activities.

* #### (2) Criteria
  * In calculating per unit limits, the Secretary shall take into account that assistance under this subchapter is intended to—

    * (A) provide nonluxury housing with suitable amenities;

    * (B) operate effectively in all jurisdictions;

    * (C) facilitate mixed-income housing; and

    * (D) reflect the costs associated with meeting the special needs of tenants or homeowners that the housing is designed to serve.

#### (g) Limitation on operating assistance
* A participating jurisdiction may not use more than 5 percent of its allocation under this part for the payment of operating expenses for community housing development organizations.

### §12743. Development of model programs
#### (a) In general
* The Secretary shall—

  * (1) in cooperation with participating jurisdictions, government-sponsored mortgage finance corporations, nonprofit organizations, the private sector, and other appropriate parties, develop, test, evaluate, refine, and, as necessary, replace a selection of model programs designed to carry out the purposes of this subchapter;

  * (2) make available to participating jurisdictions alternative model programs, which shall include suggested guidelines, procedures, forms, legal documents and such other elements as the Secretary determines to be appropriate;

  * (3) assure, insofar as is feasible, the availability of an appropriate variety of model programs designed for local market conditions, housing problems, project characteristics, and managerial capacities as they differ among participating jurisdictions;

  * (4) negotiate and enter into agreements with agencies of the Federal Government, participating jurisdictions, private financial institutions, government-sponsored mortgage finance corporations, nonprofit organizations, and other entities to provide such services, products, or financing as may be required for the implementation of a model program;

  * (5) provide detailed information on model programs as requested by participating jurisdictions, private financial institutions, developers, nonprofit organizations, and other interested parties; and

  * (6) encourage the use of such model programs to achieve efficiency, economies of scale, and effectiveness in the investment of funds made available under this part through third-party training, printed materials, and such other means of support as the Secretary determines will achieve the purpose of this subchapter.

#### (b) Adoption of programs
* Except as provided in section 12753(2) of this title, each participating jurisdiction shall have the discretion to adopt one or more model programs, adapt one or more model programs to its own requirements, design additional forms of assistance by itself or in cooperation with other participating jurisdictions, and suggest additional model programs for adoption by the Secretary as the participating jurisdiction may deem appropriate, and the Secretary may assist a participating jurisdiction in adopting, adapting, or designing one or more model programs.

#### (c) Part D programs
* The selection of model programs to be made available for adoption or adaptation shall include programs meeting the criteria set forth in part D.

### §12744. Income targeting
* Each participating jurisdiction shall invest funds made available under this part within each fiscal year so that—

  * (1) with respect to rental assistance and rental units—

    * (A) not less than 90 percent of (i) the families receiving such rental assistance are families whose incomes do not exceed 60 percent of the median family income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, (except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 60 percent of the median for the area on the basis of the Secretary's findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction cost or fair market rent, or unusually high or low family income) at the time of occupancy or at the time funds are invested, whichever is later, or (ii) the dwelling units assisted with such funds are occupied by families having such incomes; and

    * (B) the remainder of (i) the families receiving such rental assistance are households that qualify as low-income families (other than families described in subparagraph (A)) at the time of occupancy or at the time funds are invested, whichever is later, or (ii) the dwelling units assisted with such funds are occupied by such households;


  * (2) with respect to homeownership assistance, 100 percent of such funds are invested with respect to dwelling units that are occupied by households that qualify as low-income families; and

  * (3) all such funds are invested with respect to housing that qualifies as affordable housing under section 12745 of this title.

### §12745. Qualification as affordable housing
#### (a) Rental housing
* #### (1) Qualification
  * Housing that is for rental shall qualify as affordable housing under this subchapter only if the housing—

    * (A) bears rents not greater than the lesser of (i) the existing fair market rent for comparable units in the area as established by the Secretary under section 1437f of this title, or (ii) a rent that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 65 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary, with adjustment for number of bedrooms in the unit, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 65 percent of the median for the area on the basis of the Secretary's findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs or fair market rents, or unusually high or low family incomes;

    * (B) has not less than 20 percent of the units (i) occupied by very low-income families who pay as a contribution toward rent (excluding any Federal or State rental subsidy provided on behalf of the family) not more than 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income as determined by the Secretary, or (ii) occupied by very low-income families and bearing rents not greater than the gross rent for rent-restricted residential units as determined under section 42(g)(2) of title 26;

    * (C) is occupied only by households that qualify as low-income families;

    * (D) is not refused for leasing to a holder of a voucher or certificate of eligibility under section 1437f of this title because of the status of the prospective tenant as a holder of such voucher or certificate of eligibility;

    * (E) will remain affordable, according to binding commitments satisfactory to the Secretary, for the remaining useful life of the property, as determined by the Secretary, without regard to the term of the mortgage or to transfer of ownership, or for such other period that the Secretary determines is the longest feasible period of time consistent with sound economics and the purposes of this Act, except upon a foreclosure by a lender (or upon other transfer in lieu of foreclosure) if such action (i) recognizes any contractual or legal rights of public agencies, nonprofit sponsors, or others to take actions that would avoid termination of low-income affordability in the case of foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure, and (ii) is not for the purpose of avoiding low income affordability restrictions, as determined by the Secretary; and

    * (F) if newly constructed, meets the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of this title.

* #### (2) Adjustment of qualifying rent
  * The Secretary may adjust the qualifying rent established for a project under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), only if the Secretary finds that such adjustment is necessary to support the continued financial viability of the project and only by such amount as the Secretary determines is necessary to maintain continued financial viability of the project.

* #### (3) Increases in tenant income
  * Housing shall qualify as affordable housing despite a temporary noncompliance with subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (1) if such noncompliance is caused by increases in the incomes of existing tenants and if actions satisfactory to the Secretary are being taken to ensure that all vacancies are filled in accordance with paragraph (1) until such noncompliance is corrected. Tenants who no longer qualify as low-income families shall pay as rent the lesser of the amount payable by the tenant under State or local law or 30 percent of the family's adjusted monthly income, as recertified annually. The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to funds made available under this Act for units that have been allocated a low-income housing tax credit by a housing credit agency pursuant to section 42 of title 26.

* #### (4) Mixed-income project
  * Housing that accounts for less than 100 percent of the dwelling units in a project shall qualify as affordable housing if such housing meets the criteria of this section.

* #### (5) Mixed-use project
  * Housing in a project that is designed in part for uses other than residential use shall qualify as affordable housing if such housing meets the criteria of this section.

* #### (6) Waiver of qualifying rent
  * #### (A) In general
    * For the purpose of providing affordable housing appropriate for families described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary may, upon the application of the project owner, waive the applicability of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) with respect to a dwelling unit if—

      * (i) the unit is occupied by such a family, on whose behalf tenant-based assistance is provided under section 1437f of this title;

      * (ii) the rent for the unit is not greater than the existing fair market rent for comparable units in the area, as established by the Secretary under section 1437f of this title; and

      * (iii) the Secretary determines that the waiver, together with waivers under this paragraph for other dwelling units in the project, will result in the use of amounts described in clause (iii) in an effective manner that will improve the provision of affordable housing for such families.

  * #### (B) Eligible families
    * A family described in this subparagraph is a family that consists of at least one elderly person (who is the head of household) and one or more of such person's grand children, great grandchildren, great nieces, great nephews, or great great grandchildren (as defined by the Secretary), but does not include any parent of such grandchildren, great grandchildren, great nieces, great nephews, or great great grandchildren. Such term includes any such grandchildren, great grandchildren, great nieces, great nephews, or great great grandchildren who have been legally adopted by such elderly person.

#### (b) Homeownership
* Housing that is for homeownership shall qualify as affordable housing under this subchapter only if the housing—

  * (1) has an initial purchase price that does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, as determined by the Secretary with such adjustments for differences in structure, including whether the housing is single-family or multifamily, and for new and old housing as the Secretary determines to be appropriate;

  * (2) is the principal residence of an owner whose family qualifies as a low-income family—

    * (A) in the case of a contract to purchase existing housing, at the time of purchase;

    * (B) in the case of a lease-purchase agreement for existing housing or for housing to be constructed, at the time the agreement is signed; or

    * (C) in the case of a contract to purchase housing to be constructed, at the time the contract is signed;


  * (3) is subject to resale restrictions that are established by the participating jurisdiction and determined by the Secretary to be appropriate to—

    * (A) allow for subsequent purchase of the property only by persons who meet the qualifications specified under paragraph (2), at a price which will—

      * (i) provide the owner with a fair return on investment, including any improvements, and

      * (ii) ensure that the housing will remain affordable to a reasonable range of low-income homebuyers; or


    * (B) recapture the investment provided under this subchapter in order to assist other persons in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter, except where there are no net proceeds or where the net proceeds are insufficient to repay the full amount of the assistance; and


  * (4) if newly constructed, meets the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of this title.

### §12746. Participation by States and local governments
* The Secretary shall designate a State or unit of general local government to be a participating jurisdiction when it complies with procedures that the Secretary shall establish by regulation, which procedures shall only provide for the following:

* #### (1) Allocation
  * Not later than 20 days after funds to carry out this part become available (or, during the first year after November 28, 1990, not later than 20 days after (A) funds to carry out this part are provided in an appropriations Act, or (B) regulations to implement this part are promulgated, whichever is later), the Secretary shall allocate funds in accordance with section 12747 of this title and promptly notify each jurisdiction receiving a formula allocation of its allocation amount. If a jurisdiction is not already a participating jurisdiction, the Secretary shall inform the jurisdiction in writing how the jurisdiction may become a participating jurisdiction.

* #### (2) Consortia
  * A consortium of geographically contiguous units of general local government shall be deemed to be a unit of general local government for purposes of this subchapter if the Secretary determines that the consortium—

    * (A) has sufficient authority and administrative capability to carry out the purposes of this subchapter on behalf of its member jurisdictions, and

    * (B) will, according to a written certification by the State (or States, if the consortium includes jurisdictions in more than one State), direct its activities to alleviation of housing problems within the State or States.

* #### (3) Eligibility
  * (A) Except as provided in paragraph (10), a jurisdiction receiving a formula allocation under section 12747 of this title shall be eligible to become a participating jurisdiction if its formula allocation is $750,000 or greater, or if the Secretary finds that—

    * (i) the jurisdiction has a local housing authority and has demonstrated a capacity to carry out provisions of this part, and

    * (ii) the State has authorized the Secretary to transfer to the jurisdiction a portion of the State's allocation that is equal to or greater than the difference between the jurisdiction's formula allocation and $750,000, or the State or jurisdiction has made available from the State's or jurisdiction's own sources an equal amount for use by the jurisdiction in conformance with the provisions of this part.


  * (B) If a jurisdiction has met the requirements of subparagraph (A), the jurisdiction's formula allocation for a fiscal year shall subsequently be deemed to equal the sum of the jurisdiction's allocation under section 12747(a)(1) of this title and the amount made available to the jurisdiction under subparagraph (A)(ii).

* #### (4) Notification
  * If an eligible jurisdiction notifies the Secretary in writing, not later than 30 days after receiving notification under paragraph (1), of its intention to become a participating jurisdiction, the Secretary shall reserve an amount equal to the jurisdiction's allocation (plus any reallocations for which the jurisdiction is eligible under section 12747(d)(1) of this title) pending the jurisdiction's designation as a participating jurisdiction. The Secretary shall reallocate, in accordance with paragraph (6) of this section, any funds reserved under the previous sentence if the Secretary determines that the jurisdiction will not meet the requirements for designation as a participating jurisdiction within a reasonable period of time.

* #### (5) Submission of strategy
  * Not later than 90 days after providing notification under paragraph (4), an eligible jurisdiction shall submit to the Secretary a comprehensive housing affordability strategy in accordance with section 12705 of this title.

* #### (6) Reallocation
  * If the Secretary determines that a jurisdiction has failed to meet the requirements of the previous 3 paragraphs or if the Secretary, after providing for amendments and resubmissions in accordance with section 12705(c)(3) of this title, disapproves the jurisdiction's comprehensive housing affordability strategy, the Secretary shall reallocate any funds reserved for the jurisdiction as follows:

  * #### (A) State
    * If a State has failed to meet the requirements, the Secretary shall—

      * (i) make any funds reserved for the State available by direct reallocation among applications submitted by units of general local government within the State or consortia that include units of general local government within the State, insofar as approvable applications meeting the selection criteria under section 12747(c) of this title are received within 12 months after the funds become available for the direct reallocation, and

      * (ii) reallocate the remainder by formula in accordance with section 12747(b) of this title.

  * #### (B) Local
    * If a unit of general local government has failed to meet the requirements and is located in a State that is a participating jurisdiction, the Secretary shall reallocate to the State any funds reserved for the locality, with preference going to the provision of affordable housing within the locality.

  * #### (C) Direct reallocation
    * If a unit of general local government has failed to meet the requirements and is located in a State that is not a participating jurisdiction, the Secretary shall—

      * (i) make any funds reserved for the locality available for use within the State by direct reallocation among units of general local government and community housing development organizations, insofar as approvable applications meeting the selection criteria under section 12747(c) of this title are received within 12 months after the funds become available for the direct reallocation with priority going to applications for affordable housing within the locality, and

      * (ii) reallocate the remainder in accordance with section 12747(b) of this title.

  * #### (D) Certain jurisdictions deemed to be participating jurisdictions
    * If a State or unit of general local government is meeting the requirements of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), it shall be deemed to be a participating jurisdiction for purposes of reallocation under this paragraph.

* #### (7) Designation
  * The Secretary shall designate an eligible jurisdiction to be a participating jurisdiction as soon as its comprehensive housing affordability strategy is approved in accordance with section 12705 of this title.

* #### (8) Continuous designation
  * Once a State or unit of general local government is designated a participating jurisdiction, it shall remain a participating jurisdiction for subsequent fiscal years, except as provided in paragraph (9). The provisions of paragraphs (3) through (6) shall not apply to participating jurisdictions.

* #### (9) Revocation
  * The Secretary may revoke a jurisdiction's designation as a participating jurisdiction if—

    * (A) the Secretary finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, that the jurisdiction is unwilling or unable to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, or

    * (B) the jurisdiction's allocation falls below $750,000 for 3 consecutive years, below $625,000 for 2 consecutive years, or the jurisdiction does not receive a formula allocation of $500,000 or more in any 1 year, except as provided in paragraph (10).


* If a jurisdiction's designation as a participating jurisdiction is revoked, any remaining line of credit in the jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund established under section 12748 of this title shall be reallocated in accordance with paragraph (6) of this section.

* #### (10) Threshold reduction
  * If the amount appropriated pursuant to section 12724 of this title for any fiscal year is less than $1,500,000,000, then this section shall be applied during that year—

    * (A) by substituting "$500,000" for "$750,000" both places it appears in paragraph (3); and

    * (B) by substituting "$500,000", "$410,000", and "$335,000" for "$750,000", "$625,000", and "$500,000", respectively, where they appear in paragraph (9).

### §12747. Allocation of resources
#### (a) In general
* #### (1) States and units of general local government
  * After reserving amounts under paragraph (3) for the insular areas, the Secretary shall allocate funds approved in an appropriation Act to carry out this subchapter by formula as provided in subsection (b). Of the funds made available under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall initially allocate 60 percent among units of general local government and 40 percent among States.

* #### (2) Repealed. Pub. L. 104–330, title V, §505(a)(1)(B), Oct. 26, 1996, 110 Stat. 4044
* #### (3) Insular areas
  * For each fiscal year, of any amounts approved in appropriation Acts to carry out this subchapter, the Secretary shall reserve for grants to the insular areas the greater of (A) $750,000, or (B) 0.2 percent of the amounts appropriated under such Acts. The Secretary shall provide for the distribution of amounts reserved under this paragraph among the insular areas pursuant to specific criteria for such distribution, which shall be contained in a regulation issued by the Secretary.

#### (b) Formula allocation
* #### (1) In general
  * #### (A) Basic formula
    * The Secretary shall establish in regulation an allocation formula that reflects each jurisdiction's share of total need among eligible jurisdiction for an increased supply of affordable housing for very low-income and low-income families of different size, as identified by objective measures of inadequate housing supply, substandard housing, the number of low-income families in housing likely to be in need of rehabilitation, the costs of producing housing, poverty, and the relative fiscal incapacity of the jurisdiction to carry out housing activities eligible under section 12742 of this title without Federal assistance. Allocation among units of general local government shall take into account the housing needs of metropolitan cities, urban counties, and approved consortia of units of general local government.

  * #### (B) Source of data
    * The data to be used for formula allocation of funds within a fiscal year shall be data obtained from a standard source that are available to the Secretary 90 days prior to the beginning of that fiscal year.

  * #### (C) Use of basic formula
    * The basic formula established under subparagraph (A) shall be used for all formula allocations and reallocations provided for in this part.

  * #### (D) Weights
    * When allocation is made among States, the Secretary shall apply the formula in subparagraph (A) giving 20 percent weight to measures of need for the whole State and 80 percent weight to measures of need among units of general local government that are not receiving an allocation under section 12746(1) of this title.

  * #### (E) Adjustments
    * In developing the basic formula in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall (i) avoid the allocation of an excessively large share of amounts made available under this part to any one State or unit of general local government, and (ii) take into account the need for a geographic distribution of amounts made available under this part that appropriately reflects the housing need in each region of the Nation.

  * #### (F) Consultation
    * The Secretary shall develop the formula in subparagraph (A) in ongoing consultation with (i) the Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, (ii) the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives, and (iii) organizations representing States and units of general local government. Not less than 60 days prior to publishing a formula for comment, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives a copy of the formula the Secretary intends to propose.

* #### (2) Minimum State allocation
  * #### (A) In general
    * If the formula, when applied to funds approved under this section in appropriations Acts for a fiscal year, would allocate less than $3,000,000 to any State, the allocation for such State shall be $3,000,000, and the increase shall be deducted pro rata from the allocations of other States.

  * #### (B) Increased minimum allocation
    * If no unit of general local government within a State receives an allocation under paragraph (3), the State's allocation shall be increased by $500,000. Priority for use of such increased allocation shall go to the provision of affordable housing within the boundaries of metropolitan cities, urban counties, and approved consortia within the State, based on the need for such funds. The increased allocation to a State under the preceding sentence shall be derived by a pro rata deduction from the allocations to units of general local government in all States, except that such pro rata deduction shall not reduce the allocation of any unit of general local government below $500,000.

* #### (3) Minimum local allocation
  * The Secretary shall allocate funds available for formula allocation to units of general local government that, as of the end of the previous fiscal year, qualified as metropolitan cities, urban counties, and consortia approved by the Secretary in accordance with section 12746(2) of this title so that, when all such funds are initially allocated by formula, jurisdictions that are allocated an amount of $500,000 or more, and participating jurisdictions (other than consortia that fail to renew the membership of all of their member jurisdictions) that are allocated an amount less than $500,000, shall receive an allocation. Prior to announcing initial allocations, the Secretary shall successively recalculate the allocations to jurisdictions under this subsection so that the maximum number of such jurisdictions can receive initial allocations, except as provided in paragraph (4).

* #### (4) Threshold reduction
  * If the amount appropriated pursuant to section 12724 of this title for any fiscal year is less than $1,500,000,000, then this section shall be applied during that year by substituting "$335,000" for "$500,000" where it appears in paragraph (3).

#### (c) Criteria for direct reallocation
* The Secretary shall establish objective criteria for making direct reallocations to any participating jurisdiction and other eligible entities. A jurisdiction shall be eligible for a direct reallocation under this subsection only if the jurisdiction, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, submits an application that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the jurisdiction is engaged, or has made good faith efforts to engage, in cooperative efforts between the State and appropriate participating jurisdictions within the State to develop, coordinate, and implement housing strategies under this subchapter. The Secretary shall by regulation establish objective selection criteria for such direct reallocations, which criteria shall take into account—

  * (1) the applicant's demonstrated commitment to expand the supply of affordable rental housing, including units developed by public housing agencies, as indicated by the additional number of units of affordable housing made available through production or rehabilitation within the previous 2 years, making adjustment for regional variations in construction and rehabilitation costs and giving special consideration to the number of additional units made available under this subchapter through production or rehabilitation, including units developed by public housing agencies, in relation to the amounts made available under this program;

  * (2) the applicant's actions that—

    * (A) direct funds made available under this part to benefit very low-income families, with a range of incomes, in amounts that exceed the income targeting requirements of section 12744 of this title, with extra consideration given for activities that expand the supply of affordable housing for very low-income families whose incomes do not exceed 30 percent of the median family income for the area, as determined by the Secretary;
