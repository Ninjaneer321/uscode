  * (2) at the International Bureau; or

  * (3) with an intergovernmental organization.

* (a) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subsection (b), the filing date of an international design application in the United States shall be the effective registration date.

The Director may determine that the filing date of the international design application in the United States is a date other than the effective registration date.

If any claim for the benefit of an earlier filing date is based on a prior international application as defined in section 351(c) which designated but did not originate in the United States or a prior international design application which designated but did not originate in the United States, the Director may require the filing in the Patent and Trademark Office of a certified copy of such application together with a translation thereof into the English language, if it was filed in another language.

However, such withdrawn, renounced, canceled, or abandoned international design application may serve as the basis for a claim of priority under subsections (a) and (b) of section 386, or under subsection (a) or (b) of section 365, if it designated a country other than the United States.

### §389. Examination of international design application
