### SUBCHAPTER I—COMMENCEMENT OF A CASE

### §301. Voluntary cases
* (a) A voluntary case under a chapter of this title is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition under such chapter by an entity that may be a debtor under such chapter.

* (b) The commencement of a voluntary case under a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under such chapter.

### §302. Joint cases
* (a) A joint case under a chapter of this title is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a single petition under such chapter by an individual that may be a debtor under such chapter and such individual's spouse. The commencement of a joint case under a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under such chapter.

* (b) After the commencement of a joint case, the court shall determine the extent, if any, to which the debtors' estates shall be consolidated.

### §303. Involuntary cases
* (a) An involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 or 11 of this title, and only against a person, except a farmer, family farmer, or a corporation that is not a moneyed, business, or commercial corporation, that may be a debtor under the chapter under which such case is commenced.

* (b) An involuntary case against a person is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition under chapter 7 or 11 of this title—

  * (1) by three or more entities, each of which is either a holder of a claim against such person that is not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount, or an indenture trustee representing such a holder, if such noncontingent, undisputed claims aggregate at least $10,000 more than the value of any lien on property of the debtor securing such claims held by the holders of such claims;

  * (2) if there are fewer than 12 such holders, excluding any employee or insider of such person and any transferee of a transfer that is voidable under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of this title, by one or more of such holders that hold in the aggregate at least $10,000 of such claims;

  * (3) if such person is a partnership—

    * (A) by fewer than all of the general partners in such partnership; or

    * (B) if relief has been ordered under this title with respect to all of the general partners in such partnership, by a general partner in such partnership, the trustee of such a general partner, or a holder of a claim against such partnership; or


  * (4) by a foreign representative of the estate in a foreign proceeding concerning such person.


* (c) After the filing of a petition under this section but before the case is dismissed or relief is ordered, a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is not contingent, other than a creditor filing under subsection (b) of this section, may join in the petition with the same effect as if such joining creditor were a petitioning creditor under subsection (b) of this section.

* (d) The debtor, or a general partner in a partnership debtor that did not join in the petition, may file an answer to a petition under this section.

* (e) After notice and a hearing, and for cause, the court may require the petitioners under this section to file a bond to indemnify the debtor for such amounts as the court may later allow under subsection (i) of this section.

* (f) Notwithstanding section 363 of this title, except to the extent that the court orders otherwise, and until an order for relief in the case, any business of the debtor may continue to operate, and the debtor may continue to use, acquire, or dispose of property as if an involuntary case concerning the debtor had not been commenced.

* (g) At any time after the commencement of an involuntary case under chapter 7 of this title but before an order for relief in the case, the court, on request of a party in interest, after notice to the debtor and a hearing, and if necessary to preserve the property of the estate or to prevent loss to the estate, may order the United States trustee to appoint an interim trustee under section 701 of this title to take possession of the property of the estate and to operate any business of the debtor. Before an order for relief, the debtor may regain possession of property in the possession of a trustee ordered appointed under this subsection if the debtor files such bond as the court requires, conditioned on the debtor's accounting for and delivering to the trustee, if there is an order for relief in the case, such property, or the value, as of the date the debtor regains possession, of such property.

* (h) If the petition is not timely controverted, the court shall order relief against the debtor in an involuntary case under the chapter under which the petition was filed. Otherwise, after trial, the court shall order relief against the debtor in an involuntary case under the chapter under which the petition was filed, only if—

  * (1) the debtor is generally not paying such debtor's debts as such debts become due unless such debts are the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount; or

  * (2) within 120 days before the date of the filing of the petition, a custodian, other than a trustee, receiver, or agent appointed or authorized to take charge of less than substantially all of the property of the debtor for the purpose of enforcing a lien against such property, was appointed or took possession.


* (i) If the court dismisses a petition under this section other than on consent of all petitioners and the debtor, and if the debtor does not waive the right to judgment under this subsection, the court may grant judgment—

  * (1) against the petitioners and in favor of the debtor for—

    * (A) costs; or

    * (B) a reasonable attorney's fee; or


  * (2) against any petitioner that filed the petition in bad faith, for—

    * (A) any damages proximately caused by such filing; or

    * (B) punitive damages.


* (j) Only after notice to all creditors and a hearing may the court dismiss a petition filed under this section—

  * (1) on the motion of a petitioner;

  * (2) on consent of all petitioners and the debtor; or

  * (3) for want of prosecution.


* (k)(1) If—

  * (A) the petition under this section is false or contains any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement;

  * (B) the debtor is an individual; and

  * (C) the court dismisses such petition,


* the court, upon the motion of the debtor, shall seal all the records of the court relating to such petition, and all references to such petition.

* (2) If the debtor is an individual and the court dismisses a petition under this section, the court may enter an order prohibiting all consumer reporting agencies (as defined in section 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f))) from making any consumer report (as defined in section 603(d) of that Act) that contains any information relating to such petition or to the case commenced by the filing of such petition.

* (3) Upon the expiration of the statute of limitations described in section 3282 of title 18, for a violation of section 152 or 157 of such title, the court, upon the motion of the debtor and for good cause, may expunge any records relating to a petition filed under this section.

### §305. Abstention
* (a) The court, after notice and a hearing, may dismiss a case under this title, or may suspend all proceedings in a case under this title, at any time if—

  * (1) the interests of creditors and the debtor would be better served by such dismissal or suspension; or

  * (2)(A) a petition under section 1515 for recognition of a foreign proceeding has been granted; and

  * (B) the purposes of chapter 15 of this title would be best served by such dismissal or suspension.


* (b) A foreign representative may seek dismissal or suspension under subsection (a)(2) of this section.

* (c) An order under subsection (a) of this section dismissing a case or suspending all proceedings in a case, or a decision not so to dismiss or suspend, is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section 158(d), 1291, or 1292 of title 28 or by the Supreme Court of the United States under section 1254 of title 28.

### §306. Limited appearance
* An appearance in a bankruptcy court by a foreign representative in connection with a petition or request under section 303 or 305 of this title does not submit such foreign representative to the jurisdiction of any court in the United States for any other purpose, but the bankruptcy court may condition any order under section 303 or 305 of this title on compliance by such foreign representative with the orders of such bankruptcy court.

### §307. United States trustee
* The United States trustee may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in any case or proceeding under this title but may not file a plan pursuant to section 1121(c) of this title.

### §308. Debtor reporting requirements
* (a) For purposes of this section, the term "profitability" means, with respect to a debtor, the amount of money that the debtor has earned or lost during current and recent fiscal periods.

* (b) A debtor in a small business case shall file periodic financial and other reports containing information including—

  * (1) the debtor's profitability;

  * (2) reasonable approximations of the debtor's projected cash receipts and cash disbursements over a reasonable period;

  * (3) comparisons of actual cash receipts and disbursements with projections in prior reports;

  * (4) whether the debtor is—

    * (A) in compliance in all material respects with postpetition requirements imposed by this title and the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure; and

    * (B) timely filing tax returns and other required government filings and paying taxes and other administrative expenses when due;


  * (5) if the debtor is not in compliance with the requirements referred to in paragraph (4)(A) or filing tax returns and other required government filings and making the payments referred to in paragraph (4)(B), what the failures are and how, at what cost, and when the debtor intends to remedy such failures; and

  * (6) such other matters as are in the best interests of the debtor and creditors, and in the public interest in fair and efficient procedures under chapter 11 of this title.
