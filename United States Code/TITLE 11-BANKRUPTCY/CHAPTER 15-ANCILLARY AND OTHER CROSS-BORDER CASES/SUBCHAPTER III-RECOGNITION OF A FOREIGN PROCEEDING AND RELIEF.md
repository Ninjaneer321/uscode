### SUBCHAPTER III—RECOGNITION OF A FOREIGN PROCEEDING AND RELIEF

### §1515. Application for recognition
* (a) A foreign representative applies to the court for recognition of a foreign proceeding in which the foreign representative has been appointed by filing a petition for recognition.

* (b) A petition for recognition shall be accompanied by—

  * (1) a certified copy of the decision commencing such foreign proceeding and appointing the foreign representative;

  * (2) a certificate from the foreign court affirming the existence of such foreign proceeding and of the appointment of the foreign representative; or

  * (3) in the absence of evidence referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2), any other evidence acceptable to the court of the existence of such foreign proceeding and of the appointment of the foreign representative.


* (c) A petition for recognition shall also be accompanied by a statement identifying all foreign proceedings with respect to the debtor that are known to the foreign representative.

* (d) The documents referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) shall be translated into English. The court may require a translation into English of additional documents.

### §1516. Presumptions concerning recognition
* (a) If the decision or certificate referred to in section 1515(b) indicates that the foreign proceeding is a foreign proceeding and that the person or body is a foreign representative, the court is entitled to so presume.

* (b) The court is entitled to presume that documents submitted in support of the petition for recognition are authentic, whether or not they have been legalized.

* (c) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the debtor's registered office, or habitual residence in the case of an individual, is presumed to be the center of the debtor's main interests.

### §1517. Order granting recognition
* (a) Subject to section 1506, after notice and a hearing, an order recognizing a foreign proceeding shall be entered if—

  * (1) such foreign proceeding for which recognition is sought is a foreign main proceeding or foreign nonmain proceeding within the meaning of section 1502;

  * (2) the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body; and

  * (3) the petition meets the requirements of section 1515.


* (b) Such foreign proceeding shall be recognized—

  * (1) as a foreign main proceeding if it is pending in the country where the debtor has the center of its main interests; or

  * (2) as a foreign nonmain proceeding if the debtor has an establishment within the meaning of section 1502 in the foreign country where the proceeding is pending.


* (c) A petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding shall be decided upon at the earliest possible time. Entry of an order recognizing a foreign proceeding constitutes recognition under this chapter.

* (d) The provisions of this subchapter do not prevent modification or termination of recognition if it is shown that the grounds for granting it were fully or partially lacking or have ceased to exist, but in considering such action the court shall give due weight to possible prejudice to parties that have relied upon the order granting recognition. A case under this chapter may be closed in the manner prescribed under section 350.

### §1518. Subsequent information
* From the time of filing the petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative shall file with the court promptly a notice of change of status concerning—

  * (1) any substantial change in the status of such foreign proceeding or the status of the foreign representative's appointment; and

  * (2) any other foreign proceeding regarding the debtor that becomes known to the foreign representative.

### §1519. Relief that may be granted upon filing petition for recognition
* (a) From the time of filing a petition for recognition until the court rules on the petition, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, where relief is urgently needed to protect the assets of the debtor or the interests of the creditors, grant relief of a provisional nature, including—

  * (1) staying execution against the debtor's assets;

  * (2) entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the debtor's assets located in the United States to the foreign representative or another person authorized by the court, including an examiner, in order to protect and preserve the value of assets that, by their nature or because of other circumstances, are perishable, susceptible to devaluation or otherwise in jeopardy; and

  * (3) any relief referred to in paragraph (3), (4), or (7) of section 1521(a).


* (b) Unless extended under section 1521(a)(6), the relief granted under this section terminates when the petition for recognition is granted.

* (c) It is a ground for denial of relief under this section that such relief would interfere with the administration of a foreign main proceeding.

* (d) The court may not enjoin a police or regulatory act of a governmental unit, including a criminal action or proceeding, under this section.

* (e) The standards, procedures, and limitations applicable to an injunction shall apply to relief under this section.

* (f) The exercise of rights not subject to the stay arising under section 362(a) pursuant to paragraph (6), (7), (17), or (27) of section 362(b) or pursuant to section 362(o) shall not be stayed by any order of a court or administrative agency in any proceeding under this chapter.

  * (2) sections 363, 549, and 552 apply to a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property that is within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States to the same extent that the sections would apply to property of an estate;
