### §5711. Federal Trade Commission regulations
#### (a) In general
* #### (1) Advertising regulations
  * The Commission shall prescribe rules in accordance with this subsection to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices in any advertisement for pay-per-call services. Such rules shall require that the person offering such pay-per-call services—

    * (A) clearly and conspicuously disclose in any advertising the cost of the use of such telephone number, including the total cost or the cost per minute and any other fees for that service and for any other pay-per-call service to which the caller may be transferred;

    * (B) in the case of an advertisement which offers a prize or award or a service or product at no cost or for a reduced cost, clearly and conspicuously disclose the odds of being able to receive such prize, award, service, or product at no cost or reduced cost, or, if such odds are not calculable in advance, disclose the factors determining such odds;

    * (C) in the case of an advertisement that promotes a service that is not operated or expressly authorized by a Federal agency but that provides information on a Federal program, include at the beginning of such advertisement a clear disclosure that the service is not authorized, endorsed, or approved by any Federal agency;

    * (D) shall not direct such advertisement at children under the age of 12, unless such service is a bona fide educational service;

    * (E) in the case of advertising directed primarily to individuals under the age of 18, clearly and conspicuously state in such advertising that such individual must have the consent of such individual's parent or legal guardian for the use of such services;

    * (F) be prohibited from using advertisements that emit electronic tones which can automatically dial a pay-per-call telephone number;

    * (G) ensure that, whenever the number to be called is shown in television and print media advertisements, the charges for the call are clear and conspicuous and (when shown in television advertisements) displayed for the same duration as that number is displayed;

    * (H) in delivering any telephone message soliciting calls to a pay-per-call service, specify clearly, and at no less than the audible volume of the solicitation, the total cost and the cost per minute and any other fees for that service and for any other pay-per-call service to which the caller may be transferred; and

    * (I) not advertise an 800 telephone number, or any other telephone number advertised or widely understood to be toll free, from which callers are connected to an access number for a pay-per-call service.

* #### (2) Pay-per-call service standards
  * The Commission shall prescribe rules to require that each provider of pay-per-call services—

    * (A) include in each pay-per-call message an introductory disclosure message that—

      * (i) describes the service being provided;

      * (ii) specifies clearly and at a reasonably understandable volume the total cost or the cost per minute and any other fees for that service and for any other pay-per-call service to which the caller may be transferred;

      * (iii) informs the caller that charges for the call begin at the end of the introductory message;

      * (iv) informs the caller that parental consent is required for calls made by children; and

      * (v) in the case of a pay-per-call service that is not operated or expressly authorized by a Federal agency but that provides information on any Federal program, a statement that clearly states that the service is not authorized, endorsed, or approved by any Federal agency;


    * (B) enable the caller to hang up at or before the end of the introductory message without incurring any charge whatsoever;

    * (C) not direct such services at children under the age of 12, unless such service is a bona fide educational service;

    * (D) stop the assessment of time-based charges immediately upon disconnection by the caller;

    * (E) disable any bypass mechanism which allows frequent callers to avoid listening to the disclosure message described in subparagraph (A) after the institution of any price increase and for a period of time sufficient to give such frequent callers adequate and sufficient notice of the price change;

    * (F) be prohibited from providing pay-per-call services through an 800 number or other telephone number advertised or widely understood to be toll free;

    * (G) be prohibited from billing consumers in excess of the amounts described in the introductory message and from billing for services provided in violation of the rules prescribed by the Commission pursuant to this section;

    * (H) ensure that any billing statement for such provider's charges shall—

      * (i) display any charges for pay-per-call services in a part of the consumer's bill that is identified as not being related to local and long distance telephone charges; and

      * (ii) for each charge so displayed, specify, at a minimum, the type of service, the amount of the charge, and the date, time, and duration of the call;


    * (I) be liable for refunds to consumers who have been billed for pay-per-call services pursuant to programs that have been found to have violated the regulations prescribed pursuant to this section or subchapter II of this chapter or any other Federal law; and

    * (J) comply with such additional standards as the Commission may prescribe to prevent abusive practices.

* #### (3) Access to information
  * The Commission shall by rule require a common carrier that provides telephone services to a provider of pay-per-call services to make available to the Commission any records and financial information maintained by such carrier relating to the arrangements (other than for the provision of local exchange service) between such carrier and any provider of pay-per-call services.

* #### (4) Evasions
  * The rules issued by the Commission under this section shall include provisions to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices that evade such rules or undermine the rights provided to customers under this subchapter, including through the use of alternative billing or other procedures.

  * The regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) may exempt from the requirements of such paragraph—

    * (A) calls from frequent callers or regular subscribers using a bypass mechanism to avoid listening to the disclosure message required by such regulations, subject to the requirements of paragraph (2)(E); or

    * (B) pay-per-call services provided at nominal charges, as defined by the Commission in such regulations.

* #### (6) Consideration of other rules required
  * In conducting a proceeding under this section, the Commission shall consider requiring, by rule or regulation, that providers of pay-per-call services—

    * (A) automatically disconnect a call after one full cycle of the program; and

    * (B) include a beep tone or other appropriate and clear signal during a live interactive group program so that callers will be alerted to the passage of time.

* #### (7) Special rule for infrequent publications
  * The rules prescribed by the Commission under subparagraphs (A) and (G) of paragraph (1) may permit, in the case of publications that are widely distributed, that are printed annually or less frequently, and that have an established policy of not publishing specific prices, advertising that in lieu of the cost disclosures required by such subparagraphs, clearly and conspicuously disclose that use of the telephone number may result in a substantial charge.

* #### (8) Treatment of rules
  * A rule issued under this subsection shall be treated as a rule issued under section 57a(a)(1)(B) of this title.

#### (b) Notice
* The State shall serve prior written notice of any civil action under subsection (a) upon the Commission and provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint, except that if it is not feasible for the State to provide such prior notice, the State shall serve such notice immediately upon instituting such action.

#### (g) Actions by other State officials
* (1) Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit an authorized State official from proceeding in State court on the basis of an alleged violation of any general civil or criminal statute of such State.
