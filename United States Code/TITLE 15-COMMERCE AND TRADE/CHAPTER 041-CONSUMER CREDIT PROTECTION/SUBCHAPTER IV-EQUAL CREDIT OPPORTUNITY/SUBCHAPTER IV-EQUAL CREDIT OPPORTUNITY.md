  * (1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);

  * (2) because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or

#### (b) Activities not constituting discrimination
* It shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this subchapter for a creditor—

  * (2) to make an inquiry of the applicant's age or of whether the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program if such inquiry is for the purpose of determining the amount and probable continuance of income levels, credit history, or other pertinent element of credit-worthiness as provided in regulations of the Bureau;

  * (3) to use any empirically derived credit system which considers age if such system is demonstrably and statistically sound in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, except that in the operation of such system the age of an elderly applicant may not be assigned a negative factor or value;

  * (4) to make an inquiry or to consider the age of an elderly applicant when the age of such applicant is to be used by the creditor in the extension of credit in favor of such applicant; or

  * (5) to make an inquiry under section 1691c–2 of this title, in accordance with the requirements of that section.
