    * (B) formulating goals for quantum information science and engineering research and education activities to be supported by the National Science Foundation;

    * (C) leveraging the collective body of knowledge from existing quantum information science and engineering research and education activities;

    * (D) coordinating research efforts funded through existing programs across the directorates of the National Science Foundation; and

    * (E) engaging with other Federal departments and agencies, research communities, and potential users of information produced under this section.

#### (c) Graduate traineeships
* The Director of the National Science Foundation may establish a program to provide traineeships to graduate students at institutions of higher education within the United States who are citizens of the United States and who choose to pursue masters or doctoral degrees in quantum information science.

### §8842. Multidisciplinary centers for quantum research and education
#### (a) In general
* The Director of the National Science Foundation, in consultation with other Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, shall award grants to institutions of higher education or eligible nonprofit organizations (or consortia thereof) to establish at least 2, but not more than 5, Multidisciplinary Centers for Quantum Research and Education (referred to in this section as "Centers").

#### (b) Collaborations
* A collaboration receiving an award under this subsection may include institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, and private sector entities.

#### (c) Purpose
* The purpose of the Centers shall be to conduct basic research and education activities in support of the goals and priorities established under section 8813(d)(2) of this title, including by—

  * (1) continuing to advance quantum information science and engineering;

  * (2) supporting curriculum and workforce development in quantum information science and engineering; and

  * (3) fostering innovation by bringing industry perspectives to quantum research and workforce development, including by leveraging industry knowledge and resources.

#### (d) Requirements
* #### (1) In general
  * An institution of higher education or an eligible nonprofit organization (or a consortium thereof) seeking funding under this section shall submit an application to the Director of the National Science Foundation at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Director may require.

* #### (2) Applications
  * Each application under paragraph (1) shall include a description of—

    * (A) how the Center will work with other research institutions and industry partners to leverage expertise in quantum science, education and curriculum development, and technology transfer;

    * (B) how the Center will promote active collaboration among researchers in multiple disciplines involved in quantum research, including physics, engineering, mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and material science;

    * (C) how the Center will support long-term and short-term workforce development in the quantum field;

    * (D) how the Center can support an innovation ecosystem to work with industry to translate Center research into applications; and

    * (E) a long-term plan to become self-sustaining after the expiration of funding under this section.

#### (e) Selection and duration
* #### (1) In general
  * Each Center established under this section is authorized to carry out activities for a period of 5 years.

* #### (2) Reapplication
  * An awardee may reapply for additional, subsequent periods of 5 years on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis.

* #### (3) Termination
  * Consistent with the authorities of the National Science Foundation, the Director of the National Science Foundation may terminate an underperforming Center for cause during the performance period.

#### (f) Funding
* The Director of the National Science Foundation shall allocate up to $10,000,000 for each Center established under this section for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023, subject to the availability of appropriations. Amounts made available to carry out this section shall be derived from amounts appropriated or otherwise made available to the National Science Foundation.
