    * (A) any local educational agency as defined in section 7801 of title 20;

    * (B) the owner of any nonprofit elementary or secondary school building; and

    * (C) the governing authority of any school operated pursuant to section 241 of title 20, as in effect before enactment of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, or successor authority, relating to impact aid for children who reside on Federal property.


  * (2) The term "nonprofit elementary or secondary school" has the meaning given such term by section 2642(8) of this title.

  * (3) The term "radon" means the radioactive gaseous element and its short-lived decay products produced by the disintegration of the element radium occurring in air, water, soil, or other media.

  * (4) The term "school building" has the meaning given such term by section 2642(13) of this title.

### §2663. EPA citizen's guide
#### (a) Publication
* In order to make continuous progress toward the long-term goal established in section 2661 of this title, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, not later than June 1, 1989, publish and make available to the public an updated version of its document titled "A Citizen's Guide to Radon". The Administrator shall revise and republish the guide as necessary thereafter.

#### (b) Information included
