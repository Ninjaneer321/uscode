### PART A—COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL LEASE AND QUALIFIED CONTRACT GUARANTEES

### §692. Authority of Administration to guarantee payment of rentals by small business concerns under leases of commercial and industrial property
#### (a) Nonavailability of guarantees from other sources; participation with qualified sureties
* The Administration may, whenever it determines such action to be necessary or desirable, and upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, guarantee the payment of rentals under leases of commercial and industrial property entered into by small business concerns to enable such concerns to obtain such leases. Any such guarantee may be made or effected either directly or in cooperation with any qualified surety company or other qualified company through a participation agreement with such company. The foregoing powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions and limitations:

  * (1) No guarantee shall be issued by the Administration (A) if a guarantee meeting the requirements of the applicant is otherwise available on reasonable terms, and (B) unless the Administration determines that there exists a reasonable expectation that the small business concern in behalf of which the guarantee is issued will perform the covenants and conditions of the lease.

  * (2) The Administration shall, to the greatest extent practicable, exercise the powers conferred by this section in cooperation with qualified surety or other companies on a participation basis.

#### (b) Uniform annual fee; processing fees
* The Administration shall fix a uniform annual fee for its share of any guarantee under this section which shall be payable in advance at such time as may be prescribed by the Administrator. The amount of any such fee shall be determined in accordance with sound actuarial practices and procedures, to the extent practicable, but in no case shall such amount exceed, on the Administration's share of any guarantee made under this part, 2½ per centum per annum of the minimum annual guaranteed rental payable under any guaranteed lease: _Provided_, That the Administration shall fix the lowest fee that experience under the program established hereby has shown to be justified. The Administration may also fix such uniform fees for the processing of applications for guarantees under this section as the Administrator determines are reasonable and necessary to pay the administrative expenses that are incurred in connection therewith.

#### (c) Escrow; default; additional discretionary provisions
* In connection with the guarantee of rentals under any lease pursuant to authority conferred by this section, the Administrator may require, in order to minimize the financial risk assumed under such guarantee—

  * (1) that the lessee pay an amount, not to exceed one-fourth of the minimum guaranteed annual rental required under the lease, which shall be held in escrow and shall be available (A) to meet rental charges accruing in any month for which the lessee is in default, or (B) if no default occurs during the term of the lease, for application (with accrued interest) toward final payments of rental charges under the lease;

  * (2) that upon occurrence of a default under the lease, the lessor shall, as a condition precedent to enforcing any claim under the lease guarantee, utilize the entire period, for which there are funds available in escrow for payment of rentals, in reasonably diligent efforts to eliminate or minimize losses, by releasing the commercial or industrial property covered by the lease to another qualified tenant, and no claim shall be made or paid under the guarantee until such effort has been made and such escrow funds have been exhausted;

  * (3) that any guarantor of the lease will become a successor of the lessor for the purpose of collecting from a lessee in default rentals which are in arrears and with respect to which the lessor has received payment under a guarantee made pursuant to this section; and

  * (4) such other provisions, not inconsistent with the purposes of this part, as the Administrator may in his discretion require.

### §693. Powers of Administration respecting loans; liquidation of obligations through creation of new leases, execution of subleases, and assignments of leases
* Without limiting the authority conferred upon the Administrator and the Administration by section 671 of this title, the Administrator and the Administration shall have, in the performance of and with respect to the functions, powers, and duties conferred by this part, all the authority and be subject to the same conditions prescribed in section 634(b) of this title with respect to loans, including the authority to execute subleases, assignments of lease and new leases with any person, firm, organization, or other entity, in order to aid in the liquidation of obligations of the Administration hereunder.

### §694–1. Planning design or installation of pollution control facilities
#### (a) Definitions
* For purposes of this section, the term—

  * (1) "pollution control facilities" means such property (both real and personal) as the Administration in its discretion determines is likely to help prevent, reduce, abate, or control noise, air or water pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing or storing pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat, and such property (both real and personal) as the Administration determines will be used for the collection, storage, treatment, utilization, processing, or final disposal of solid or liquid waste.

  * (2) "person" includes corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, joint stock companies, States, territories, and possessions of the United States, or subdivisions of any of the foregoing, and the District of Columbia, as well as individuals.

  * (3) "qualified contract" means a lease, sublease, loan agreement, installment sales contract, or similar instrument, entered into between a small business concern and any person.

#### (b) Financing disadvantage; guarantee of payment by Administration; restrictions and limitations
* The Administration may, whenever it determines that small business concerns are or are likely to be at an operational or financing disadvantage with other business concerns with respect to the planning, design, or installation of pollution control facilities, or the obtaining of financing therefor (including financing by means of revenue bonds issued by States, political subdivisions thereof, or other public bodies), guarantee the payment of rentals or other amounts due under qualified contracts. Any such guarantee may be made or effected either directly or in cooperation with any qualified surety company or other qualified company through a participation agreement with such company. The foregoing powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions and limitations:

  * (1) Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation or fiscal policy to the contrary, the guarantee authorized in the case of pollution control facilities or property shall be issued when such property is acquired by the use of proceeds from industrial revenue bonds which provide the holders interest which is exempt from Federal income tax, and the Administration is expressly prohibited from denying such guarantee due to the property being so acquired.

  * (2) Any such guarantee shall be for the full amount of the payments due under such qualified contract and shall be a full faith and credit obligation of the United States.

  * (3) No guarantee shall be issued by the Administration unless the Administration determines that there exists a reasonable expectation that the small business concern in behalf of which the guarantee is issued will perform the covenants and conditions of the qualified contract.

#### (c) Uniform annual fees; processing fees; time and condition for payment; periodic review
* The Administration shall fix a uniform annual fee for any guarantee issued under this section which shall be payable at such time and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator. The fee shall be set at an amount which the Administration deems reasonable and necessary and shall be subject to periodic review in order that the lowest fee that experience under the program shows to be justified will be placed into effect. In no case shall such amount be less than 1 per centum or more than 3½ per centum per annum of the minimum annual guaranteed rental payable under any qualified contract guaranteed under this section. The Administration may also fix such uniform fees for the processing of applications for guarantees under this section as the Administrator determines are reasonable and necessary to pay the administrative expenses that are incurred in connection therewith.

#### (d) Requirements of Administration; escrow; default; discretionary provisions
* In connection with the guarantee of rentals under any qualified contract pursuant to authority conferred by this section, the Administrator may require, in order to minimize the financial risk assumed under such guarantee—

  * (1) that the lessee pay an amount, not to exceed one-fourth of the average annual payments for which a guarantee is issued under this section, which shall be held in escrow and shall be available (A) to meet rental charges accruing in any month for which the lessee is in default, or (B) if no default occurs during the term of the qualified contract, for application (with accrued interest) toward final payments of rental charges under the qualified contract;

  * (2) that upon occurrence of a default under the qualified contract, the lessor shall, as a condition precedent to enforcing any claim under the qualified contract guarantee, utilize the entire period, for which there are funds available in escrow for payment of rentals, in reasonable diligent efforts to eliminate or minimize losses, by releasing the property covered by the qualified contract to another qualified lessee, and no claim shall be made or paid under the guarantee until such effort has been made and such escrow funds have been exhausted;

  * (3) that any guarantor of the qualified contract will become a successor of the lessor for the purpose of collecting from a lessee in default rentals which are in arrears and with respect to which the lessor has received payment under a guarantee made pursuant to this section; and

  * (4) such other provisions, not inconsistent with the purposes of this section as the Administrator may in his discretion require.

#### (e) Assignment of guarantee
* Any guarantee issued under this section may be assigned with the permission of the Administration by the person to whom the payments under qualified contracts are due.

#### (f) Application of section 693 of this title
* Section 693 of this title shall apply to the administration of this section.

### §694–2. Revolving fund for qualified contract guarantees; investment of idle funds
* There is created within the Treasury a separate fund for guarantees which shall be available to the Administrator without fiscal year limitations as a revolving fund for the purpose of section 694–1 of this title. All amounts received by the Administrator, including any moneys, property, or assets derived by him from his operations in connection with section 694–1 of this title shall be deposited in the fund. All expenses and payments, excluding administrative expenses, pursuant to operations of the Administrator under section 694–1 of this title shall be paid from the fund. Moneys in the fund not needed for the payment of current operating expenses or for the payment of claims arising under this part may be invested in bonds or other obligations of, or bonds or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States; except that moneys provided as capital for the fund shall not be so invested.
