### SUBCHAPTER II—METRIC CONVERSION

### §205a. Congressional statement of findings
* The Congress finds as follows:

  * (1) The United States was an original signatory party to the 1875 Treaty of the Meter (20 Stat. 709), which established the General Conference of Weights and Measures, the International Committee of Weights and Measures and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.

  * (2) Although the use of metric measurement standards in the United States has been authorized by law since 1866 (Act of July 28, 1866; 14 Stat. 339), this Nation today is the only industrially developed nation which has not established a national policy of committing itself and taking steps to facilitate conversion to the metric system.

  * (3) World trade is increasingly geared towards the metric system of measurement.

  * (4) Industry in the United States is often at a competitive disadvantage when dealing in international markets because of its nonstandard measurement system, and is sometimes excluded when it is unable to deliver goods which are measured in metric terms.

  * (5) The inherent simplicity of the metric system of measurement and standardization of weights and measures has led to major cost savings in certain industries which have converted to that system.

  * (6) The Federal Government has a responsibility to develop procedures and techniques to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement.

  * (7) The metric system of measurement can provide substantial advantages to the Federal Government in its own operations.

### §205b. Declaration of policy
* It is therefore the declared policy of the United States—

  * (1) to designate the metric system of measurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce;

  * (2) to require that each Federal agency, by a date certain and to the extent economically feasible by the end of the fiscal year 1992, use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business-related activities, except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units;

  * (3) to seek out ways to increase understanding of the metric system of measurement through educational information and guidance and in Government publications; and

  * (4) to permit the continued use of traditional systems of weights and measures in non-business activities.
