### SUBCHAPTER II—OCTANE DISCLOSURE

### §2821. Definitions
* As used in this subchapter:

  * (1) The term "octane rating" means the rating of the antiknock characteristics of a grade or type of automotive fuel as determined by dividing by 2 the sum of the research octane number plus the motor octane number, unless another procedure is prescribed under section 2823(c)(3) of this title, in which case such term means the rating of such characteristics as determined under the procedure so prescribed.

#### (c) Display of automotive fuel rating by automotive fuel retailer; use of automotive fuel rating for display
* Each automotive fuel retailer shall display in a clear and conspicuous manner, at the point of sale to ultimate purchasers of automotive fuel, the automotive fuel rating of such automotive fuel, which automotive fuel rating shall be consistent with—

  * (1) the automotive fuel rating of such automotive fuel certified to such retailer under subsection (a)(2) or (b);

  * (2) if such automotive fuel retailer elects (at such time and in such manner as the Federal Trade Commission may, by rule, prescribe), the automotive fuel rating of such automotive fuel determined by such retailer for such automotive fuel; or

  * (3) if such automotive fuel retailer is a refiner, the automotive fuel rating of such automotive fuel determined under subsection (a)(1).

#### (d) Display or representation of automotive fuel requirements for new motor vehicles by manufacturer of such vehicles; promulgation of rules by Federal Trade Commission
