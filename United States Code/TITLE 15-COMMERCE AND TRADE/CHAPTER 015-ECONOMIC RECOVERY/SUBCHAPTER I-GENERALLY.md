* With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to issue and have outstanding at any one time, bonds, notes, debentures, and other similar obligations in an aggregate amount not exceeding $30,000,000,000. Such obligations shall be in such forms and denominations, shall have such maturities, shall bear such rates of interest, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall be issued in such manner and sold at such prices as may be prescribed by the Commodity Credit Corporation, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such obligations shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed both as to interest and principal by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face thereof, and such obligations shall be lawful investments and may be accepted as security for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds the investment or deposit of which shall be under the authority or control of the United States or any officer or officers thereof. In the event that the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be unable to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of, or interest on, such obligations, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holder the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, is authorized to purchase any obligations of the Commodity Credit Corporation issued hereunder, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31 and the purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchases of the Commodity Credit Corporation's obligations hereunder. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the obligations of the Commodity Credit Corporation acquired by him under this section.

No such obligations shall be issued in excess of the assets of the Commodity Credit Corporation, including the assets to be obtained from the proceeds of such obligations, but a failure to comply with this provision shall not invalidate the obligations or the guaranty of the same: _Provided_, That this sentence shall not limit the authority of the Corporation to issue obligations for the purpose of carrying out its annual budget programs submitted to and approved by the Congress pursuant to chapter 91 of title 31. The Commodity Credit Corporation shall have power to purchase such obligations in the open market at any time and at any price.

### §713a–5. Exemption of Commodity Credit Corporation and its obligations from taxation
* Bonds, notes, debentures, and other similar obligations issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation under the provisions of sections 713a–1 to 713a–5 of this title shall be deemed and held to be instrumentalities of the Government of the United States, and as such they and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes). The Commodity Credit Corporation, including its franchise, its capital, reserves, and surplus, and its income shall be exempt from all taxation imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority; except that any real property of the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be subject to State, Territorial, county, municipal, or local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed.

### §713a–6. Sale of surplus agricultural commodities to foreign governments
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commodity Credit Corporation, with the approval of the President, is authorized to sell surplus agricultural commodities, acquired by such Corporation through its loan operations, to foreign governments on the condition that, except for rotation to prevent deterioration, such commodities shall be held in reserve by such governments for a period of not less than five years from the date of acquisition, and shall not be disposed of unless a war or war emergency results in a serious interruption of normal supplies of such commodities: _Provided_, That under this section no concession below the prevailing world market price for the unrestricted use of such commodities, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, shall be granted, in consideration of the obligation assumed by such governments to hold such commodities in reserve as required hereinbefore, in excess of a maximum amount equal to the average carrying charges, as estimated by the Secretary of Agriculture, that would be incurred if such commodities should be held for an additional eighteen months' period by the Commodity Credit Corporation. In determining specific cotton to be sold under this section, the determination shall be made by sampling and selection at the place where the cotton is stored on the date of signing any sales agreement or contract under this section, and no cotton shall be sold under any such sales agreement or contract which, after such date, is transported to any other place and there sampled and selected: _Provided further_, That in case of a sale, settlement must be made within sixty days after delivery and not more than five hundred thousand bales of cotton shall be sold upon the terms and conditions provided in this section.

### §713a–7. Exchange of surplus agricultural commodities for reserve stocks of strategic materials

In order to carry out the provisions of this section, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized, upon terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, to procure, convey, transport, handle, store, maintain, or rotate such surplus agricultural commodities, and such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials, as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.

* The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized and directed to transfer to warehouses in or near cotton manufacturing centers in New England not to exceed three hundred thousand bales of cotton, to which it now has title or may hereafter acquire title, having regard for the grades and staples customarily required by manufacturers in that area: _Provided_, That all necessary costs in connection with such transfer will not result in additional net cost to the Corporation.

* In determining specific cotton to be exchanged under this section, the determination shall be made by sampling and selection at the place where the cotton is stored on the date of ratification of a treaty providing for such exchange, and no cotton shall be exchanged under such treaty which, after such date, is transported to another place and there sampled and selected. Such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials shall be stored on military or naval reservations or in other locations approved by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy. The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to transfer such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture shall approve, to any other governmental agency. Such reserve stocks or strategic and critical materials shall be made available or disposed of by the Commodity Credit Corporation or other governmental agency only upon order of the President in accordance with the terms of the applicable treaty; when necessary to prevent deterioration, the Commodity Credit Corporation or other governmental agency is authorized to replace those quantities of the reserve stocks of such strategic and critical materials subject to deterioration with equivalent quantities of the same materials. The funds now or hereafter made available to the Commodity Credit Corporation are made available to carry out the purposes of this section. There is authorized to be appropriated such additional sums as may be required to carry out the provisions of this section.

### §713a–11. Annual appropriations to reimburse Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized loss
* There is authorized to be appropriated annually for each fiscal year by means of a current, indefinite appropriation, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an amount sufficient to reimburse Commodity Credit Corporation for its net realized loss incurred during such fiscal year, as reflected in its accounts and shown in its report of its financial condition as of the close of such fiscal year.
