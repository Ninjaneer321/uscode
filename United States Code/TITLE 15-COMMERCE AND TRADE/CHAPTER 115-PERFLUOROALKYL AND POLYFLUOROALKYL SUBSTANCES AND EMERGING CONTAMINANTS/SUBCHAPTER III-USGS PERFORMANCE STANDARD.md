### SUBCHAPTER III—USGS PERFORMANCE STANDARD

### §8931. Definitions
* In this subchapter:

* #### (1) Director
  * The term "Director" means the Director of the United States Geological Survey.

* #### (2) Highly fluorinated compound
  * #### (A) In general
    * The term "highly fluorinated compound" means a perfluoroalkyl substance or a polyfluoroalkyl substance with at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom.

  * #### (B) Definitions
    * In this paragraph:

    * #### (i) Fully fluorinated carbon atom
      * The term "fully fluorinated carbon atom" means a carbon atom on which all the hydrogen substituents have been replaced by fluorine.

    * #### (ii) Perfluoroalkyl substance
      * The term "perfluoroalkyl substance" means a chemical of which all of the carbon atoms are fully fluorinated carbon atoms.

    * #### (iii) Polyfluoroalkyl substance
      * The term "polyfluoroalkyl substance" means a chemical containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom and at least one carbon atom that is not a fully fluorinated carbon atom.

### §8932. Performance standard for the detection of highly fluorinated compounds
#### (a) In general
* The Director, in consultation with the Administrator, shall establish a performance standard for the detection of highly fluorinated compounds.

#### (b) Emphasis
* #### (1) In general
  * In developing the performance standard under subsection (a), the Director shall emphasize the ability to detect as many highly fluorinated compounds present in the environment as possible using validated analytical methods that—

    * (A) achieve limits of quantitation (as defined in the document of the United States Geological Survey entitled "Analytical Methods for Chemical Analysis of Geologic and Other Materials, U.S. Geological Survey" and dated 2002); and

    * (B) are as sensitive as is feasible and practicable.

* #### (2) Requirement
  * In developing the performance standard under subsection (a), the Director may—

    * (A) develop quality assurance and quality control measures to ensure accurate sampling and testing;

    * (B) develop a training program with respect to the appropriate method of sample collection and analysis of highly fluorinated compounds; and

    * (C) coordinate as necessary with the Administrator, including, if appropriate, to develop methods to detect individual and different highly fluorinated compounds simultaneously.

### §8933. Nationwide sampling
#### (a) In general
* The Director shall carry out a nationwide sampling to determine the concentration of highly fluorinated compounds in estuaries, lakes, streams, springs, wells, wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and soil using the performance standard developed under section 8932(a) of this title.

#### (b) Requirements
* In carrying out the sampling under subsection (a), the Director shall—

  * (1) first carry out the sampling at sources of drinking water near locations with known or suspected releases of highly fluorinated compounds;

  * (2) when carrying out sampling of sources of drinking water under paragraph (1), carry out the sampling prior to and, at the request of the Administrator, after any treatment of the water;

  * (3) survey for ecological exposure to highly fluorinated compounds, with a priority in determining direct human exposure through drinking water; and

  * (4) consult with—

    * (A) States to determine areas that are a priority for sampling; and

    * (B) the Administrator—

      * (i) to enhance coverage of the sampling; and

      * (ii) to avoid unnecessary duplication.

#### (c) Report
* Not later than 120 days after the completion of the sampling under subsection (a), the Director shall prepare a report describing the results of the sampling and submit the report to—

  * (1) the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate;

  * (2) the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives;

  * (3) the Senators of each State in which the Director carried out the sampling; and

  * (4) each Member of the House of Representatives who represents a district in which the Director carried out the sampling.

### §8934. Data usage
#### (a) In general
* The Director shall provide the sampling data collected under section 8933 of this title to—

  * (1) the Administrator; and

  * (2) other Federal and State regulatory agencies on request.

#### (b) Usage
* The sampling data provided under subsection (a) shall be used to inform and enhance assessments of exposure, likely health and environmental impacts, and remediation priorities.

### §8935. Collaboration
* In carrying out this subchapter, the Director shall collaborate with—

  * (1) appropriate Federal and State regulators;

  * (2) institutions of higher education;

  * (3) research institutions; and

  * (4) other expert stakeholders.
