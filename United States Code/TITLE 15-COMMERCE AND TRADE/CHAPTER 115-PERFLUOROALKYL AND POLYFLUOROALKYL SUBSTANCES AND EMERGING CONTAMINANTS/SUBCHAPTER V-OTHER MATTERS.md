### SUBCHAPTER V—OTHER MATTERS

### §8961. PFAS destruction and disposal guidance
#### (a) In general
* Not later than 1 year after December 20, 2019, the Administrator shall publish interim guidance on the destruction and disposal of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and materials containing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, including—

  * (1) aqueous film-forming foam;

  * (2) soil and biosolids;

  * (3) textiles, other than consumer goods, treated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances;

  * (4) spent filters, membranes, resins, granular carbon, and other waste from water treatment;

  * (5) landfill leachate containing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances; and

  * (6) solid, liquid, or gas waste streams containing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances from facilities manufacturing or using perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

#### (b) Considerations; inclusions
* The interim guidance under subsection (a) shall—

  * (1) take into consideration—

    * (A) the potential for releases of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances during destruction or disposal, including through volatilization, air dispersion, or leachate; and

    * (B) potentially vulnerable populations living near likely destruction or disposal sites; and


  * (2) provide guidance on testing and monitoring air, effluent, and soil near potential destruction or disposal sites for releases described in paragraph (1)(A).

#### (c) Revisions
* The Administrator shall publish revisions to the interim guidance under subsection (a) as the Administrator determines to be appropriate, but not less frequently than once every 3 years.

### §8962. PFAS research and development
#### (a) In general
* The Administrator, acting through the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Research and Development, shall—

  * (1)(A) further examine the effects of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances on human health and the environment; and

  * (B) make publicly available information relating to the findings under subparagraph (A);

  * (2) develop a process for prioritizing which perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or classes of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, should be subject to additional research efforts that is based on—

    * (A) the potential for human exposure to the substances or classes of substances;

    * (B) the potential toxicity of the substances or classes of substances; and

    * (C) information available about the substances or classes of substances;


  * (3) develop new tools to characterize and identify perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the environment, including in drinking water, wastewater, surface water, groundwater, solids, and the air;

  * (4) evaluate approaches for the remediation of contamination by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the environment; and

  * (5) develop and implement new tools and materials to communicate with the public about perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

#### (b) Funding
* There is authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator to carry out this section $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2024.
