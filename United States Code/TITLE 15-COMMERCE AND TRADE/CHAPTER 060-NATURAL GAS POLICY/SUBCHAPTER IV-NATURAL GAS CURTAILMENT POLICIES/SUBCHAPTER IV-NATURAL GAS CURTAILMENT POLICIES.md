### SUBCHAPTER IV—NATURAL GAS CURTAILMENT POLICIES

### §3391. Natural gas for essential agricultural uses
#### (a) General rule
* Not later than 120 days after November 9, 1978, the Secretary of Energy shall prescribe and make effective a rule, which may be amended from time to time, which provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law (other than subsection (b)) and to the maximum extent practicable, no curtailment plan of an interstate pipeline may provide for curtailment of deliveries of natural gas for any essential agricultural use, unless such curtailment—

  * (1) does not reduce the quantity of natural gas delivered for such use below the use requirement specified in subsection (c); or

  * (2) is necessary in order to meet the requirements of high-priority users.

#### (b) Curtailment priority not applicable if alternative fuel available
* If the Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, determines, by rule or order, that use of a fuel (other than natural gas) is economically practicable and that the fuel is reasonably available as an alternative for any agricultural use of natural gas, the provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to any curtailment of deliveries for such use.

#### (c) Determination of essential agricultural use requirements
* The Secretary of Agriculture shall certify to the Secretary of Energy and the Commission the natural gas requirements (expressed either as volumes or percentages of use) of persons (or classes thereof) for essential agricultural uses in order to meet the requirements of full food and fiber production.

#### (d) Authority of Secretary of Agriculture to intervene
* The Secretary of Agriculture may intervene as a matter of right in any proceeding before the Commission which is conducted in connection with implementing the requirements of the rule prescribed under subsection (a).

#### (e) Limitation

  * (2) is necessary in order to meet the requirements of high-priority users; or

  * (3) is necessary in order to meet the requirements for essential agricultural uses of natural gas for which curtailment priority is established under section 3391 of this title.

#### (b) Curtailment priority applicable only if alternative fuel not available
* The provisions of subsection (a) shall apply with respect to any curtailment of deliveries for any essential industrial process or feedstock use only if the Commission determines that use of a fuel (other than natural gas) is not economically practicable and that no fuel is reasonably available as an alternative for such use.
