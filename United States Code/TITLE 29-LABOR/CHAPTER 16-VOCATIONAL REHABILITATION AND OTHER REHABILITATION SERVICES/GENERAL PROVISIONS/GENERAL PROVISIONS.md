#### (a) Findings
* With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VII, the Congress finds as follows:

* #### (1) Racial profile
  * The demographic profile of America is rapidly changing.

* #### (2) Rate of disability
  * Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. In 2011—

    * (A) among Americans ages 16 through 64, the rate of disability was 12.1 percent;

    * (B) among African-Americans in that age range, the disability rate was more than twice as high, at 27.1 percent; and

As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.

* #### (4) Recruitment
  * Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.

#### (b) Outreach to minorities

  * For each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (referred to in this subsection as the "Director") shall reserve 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year for programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII to carry out this subsection.

* #### (2) Activities
  * The activities carried out by the Commissioner and the Director shall include one or more of the following:

    * (A) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to carry out activities under the programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII.

    * (B) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to conduct research, training, technical assistance, or a related activity, to improve services provided under this chapter, especially services provided to individuals from minority backgrounds.

    * (C) Making awards to entities described in paragraph (3) to provide outreach and technical assistance to minority entities and Indian tribes to promote their participation in activities funded under this chapter, including assistance to enhance their capacity to carry out such activities.

* #### (3) Eligibility
  * To be eligible to receive an award under paragraph (2)(C), an entity shall be a State or a public or private nonprofit agency or organization, such as an institution of higher education or an Indian tribe.

* #### (4) Report
  * In each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director shall prepare and submit to Congress a report that describes the activities funded under this subsection for the preceding fiscal year.

* #### (5) Definitions
  * In this subsection:

  * #### (A) Historically Black college or university
    * The term "historically Black college or university" means a part B institution, as defined in section 1061(2) of title 20.

  * #### (B) Minority entity
    * The term "minority entity" means an entity that is a historically Black college or university, a Hispanic-serving institution of higher education, an American Indian tribal college or university, or another institution of higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 50 percent.

#### (c) Demonstration
* In awarding grants, or entering into contracts or cooperative agreements under subchapters I, II, III, VI, and VII of this chapter, and section 794e of this title, the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, in appropriate cases, shall require applicants to demonstrate how the applicants will address, in whole or in part, the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority backgrounds.
