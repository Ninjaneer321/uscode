  * (1) is an employee pension benefit plan (as defined in paragraph (2) of section 1002 of this title) established or maintained—

    * (A) by an employer engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce, or

    * (B) by any employee organization, or organization representing employees, engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce, or

    * (C) by both,


* which has, in practice, met the requirements of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 (as in effect for the preceding 5 plan years of the plan) applicable to the plans described in paragraph (2) for the preceding 5 plan years; or

  * (2) is, or has been determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be, a plan described in section 401(a) of title 26, or which meets, or has been determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to meet, the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26.


* For purposes of this subchapter, a successor plan is considered to be a continuation of a predecessor plan. For this purpose, unless otherwise specifically indicated in this subchapter, a successor plan is a plan which covers a group of employees which includes substantially the same employees as a previously established plan, and provides substantially the same benefits as that plan provided.

#### (b) Plans not covered
* This section does not apply to any plan—

  * (1) which is an individual account plan, as defined in paragraph (34) of section 1002 of this title,

  * (2) established and maintained for its employees by the Government of the United States, by the government of any State or political subdivision thereof, or by any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing, or to which the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935 or 1937 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] applies and which is financed by contributions required under that Act, or which is described in the last sentence of section 1002(32) of this title

  * (3) which is a church plan as defined in section 414(e) of title 26, unless that plan has made an election under section 410(d) of title 26, and has notified the corporation in accordance with procedures prescribed by the corporation, that it wishes to have the provisions of this part apply to it,

  * (4)(A) established and maintained by a society, order, or association described in section 501(c)(8) or (9) of title 26, if no part of the contributions to or under the plan is made by employers of participants in the plan, or

  * (B) of which a trust described in section 501(c)(18) of title 26 is a part;

  * (5) which has not at any time after September 2, 1974, provided for employer contributions;

  * (6) which is unfunded and which is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees;

  * (7) which is established and maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of individuals substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens;

  * (8) which is maintained by an employer solely for the purpose of providing benefits for certain employees in excess of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by section 415 of title 26 on plans to which that section applies, without regard to whether the plan is funded, and, to the extent that a separable part of a plan (as determined by the corporation) maintained by an employer is maintained for such purpose, that part shall be treated for purposes of this subchapter, as a separate plan which is an excess benefit plan;

  * (9) which is established and maintained exclusively for substantial owners;

  * (10) of an international organization which is exempt from taxation under the International Organizations Immunities Act [22 U.S.C. 288 et seq.];

  * (11) maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable workmen's compensation laws or unemployment compensation or disability insurance laws;

  * (12) which is a defined benefit plan, to the extent that it is treated as an individual account plan under paragraph (35)(B) of section 1002 of this title; or

  * (13) established and maintained by a professional service employer which does not at any time after September 2, 1974, have more than 25 active participants in the plan.

#### (c) Definitions
* (1) For purposes of subsection (b)(1), the term "individual account plan" does not include a plan under which a fixed benefit is promised if the employer or his representative participated in the determination of that benefit.

* (2) For purposes of this paragraph and for purposes of subsection (b)(13)—

  * (A) the term "professional service employer" means any proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other association or organization (i) owned or controlled by professional individuals or by executors or administrators of professional individuals, (ii) the principal business of which is the performance of professional services, and

  * (B) the term "professional individuals" includes but is not limited to, physicians, dentists, chiropractors, osteopaths, optometrists, other licensed practitioners of the healing arts, attorneys at law, public accountants, public engineers, architects, draftsmen, actuaries, psychologists, social or physical scientists, and performing artists.


* (3) In the case of a plan established and maintained by more than one professional service employer, the plan shall not be treated as a plan described in subsection (b)(13) if, at any time after September 2, 1974, the plan has more than 25 active participants.

#### (d) Substantial owner defined
* For purposes of subsection (b)(9), the term "substantial owner" means an individual who, at any time during the 60-month period ending on the date the determination is being made—

  * (1) owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business,

  * (2) in the case of a partnership, is a partner who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest in such partnership, or

  * (3) in the case of a corporation, owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent in value of either the voting stock of that corporation or all the stock of that corporation.


* For purposes of paragraph (3), the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) of title 26 (other than paragraph (3)(C) thereof) shall apply, including the application of such rules under section 414(c) of title 26.

### §1322. Single-employer plan benefits guaranteed
#### (a) Nonforfeitable benefits
* Subject to the limitations contained in subsection (b), the corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a single-employer plan which terminates at a time when this subchapter applies to it.

#### (b) Exceptions
* (1) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (7)—

  * (A) no benefits provided by a plan which has been in effect for less than 60 months at the time the plan terminates shall be guaranteed under this section, and

  * (B) any increase in the amount of benefits under a plan resulting from a plan amendment which was made, or became effective, whichever is later, within 60 months before the date on which the plan terminates shall be disregarded.


* (2) For purposes of this subsection, the time a successor plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) has been in effect includes the time a previously established plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) was in effect. For purposes of determining what benefits are guaranteed under this section in the case of a plan to which section 1321 of this title does not apply on September 3, 1974, the 60-month period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed beginning on the first date on which such section does apply to the plan.

* (3) The amount of monthly benefits described in subsection (a) provided by a plan, which are guaranteed under this section with respect to a participant, shall not have an actuarial value which exceeds the actuarial value of a monthly benefit in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 65 equal to the lesser of—

  * (A) his average monthly gross income from his employer during the 5 consecutive calendar year period (or, if less, during the number of calendar years in such period in which he actively participates in the plan) during which his gross income from that employer was greater than during any other such period with that employer determined by dividing 1/12 of the sum of all such gross income by the number of such calendar years in which he had such gross income, or

  * (B) $750 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 430]) in effect at the time the plan terminates and the denominator of which is such contribution and benefit base in effect in calendar year 1974.


* The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to non-basic benefits. The maximum guaranteed monthly benefit shall not be reduced solely on account of the age of a participant in the case of a benefit payable by reason of disability that occurred on or before the termination date, if the participant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that the Social Security Administration has determined that the participant satisfies the definition of disability under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.; 1381 et seq.], and the regulations thereunder. If a benefit payable by reason of disability is converted to an early or normal retirement benefit for reasons other than a change in the health of the participant, such early or normal retirement benefit shall be treated as a continuation of the benefit payable by reason of disability and this subparagraph shall continue to apply.

* (4)(A) The actuarial value of a benefit, for purposes of this subsection, shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.

* (B) For purposes of paragraph (3)—

  * (i) the term "gross income" means "earned income" within the meaning of section 911(b) of title 26 (determined without regard to any community property laws),

  * (ii) in the case of a participant in a plan under which contributions are made by more than one employer, amounts received as gross income from any employer under that plan shall be aggregated with amounts received from any other employer under that plan during the same period, and

  * (iii) any non-basic benefit shall be disregarded.


* (5)(A) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "majority owner" means an individual who, at any time during the 60-month period ending on the date the determination is being made—

  * (i) owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business,

  * (ii) in the case of a partnership, is a partner who owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of either the capital interest or the profits interest in such partnership, or

  * (iii) in the case of a corporation, owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more in value of either the voting stock of that corporation or all the stock of that corporation.


* For purposes of clause (iii), the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) of title 26 (other than paragraph (3)(C) thereof) shall apply, including the application of such rules under section 414(c) of title 26.

* (B) In the case of a participant who is a majority owner, the amount of benefits guaranteed under this section shall equal the product of—

  * (i) a fraction (not to exceed 1) the numerator of which is the number of years from the later of the effective date or the adoption date of the plan to the termination date, and the denominator of which is 10, and

  * (ii) the amount of benefits that would be guaranteed under this section if the participant were not a majority owner.


* (6)(A) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury issues notice that he has determined that any trust which is a part of a plan does not meet the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26, or that the plan does not meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous. This subparagraph does not apply if the Secretary subsequently issues a notice that such trust meets the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26 or that the plan meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26 and if the Secretary determines that the trust or plan has taken action necessary to meet such requirements during the period between the issuance of the notice referred to in the preceding sentence and the issuance of the notice referred to in this sentence.

* (B) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which an amendment of the plan is adopted which causes the Secretary of the Treasury to determine that any trust under the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26 or that the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous. This subparagraph shall not apply if the amendment is revoked as of the date it was first effective or amended to comply with such requirements.

* (7) Benefits described in paragraph (1) are guaranteed only to the extent of the greater of—

  * (A) 20 percent of the amount which, but for the fact that the plan or amendment has not been in effect for 60 months or more, would be guaranteed under this section, or

  * (B) $20 per month,


* multiplied by the number of years (but not more than 5) the plan or amendment, as the case may be, has been in effect. In determining how many years a plan or amendment has been in effect for purposes of this paragraph, the first 12 months beginning with the date on which the plan or amendment is made or first becomes effective (whichever is later) constitutes one year, and each consecutive period of 12 months thereafter constitutes an additional year. This paragraph does not apply to benefits payable under a plan unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this subchapter.

* (8) If an unpredictable contingent event benefit (as defined in section 1056(g)(1) of this title) is payable by reason of the occurrence of any event, this section shall be applied as if a plan amendment had been adopted on the date such event occurred.

#### (c) Payment by corporation to participants and beneficiaries of recovery percentage of outstanding amount of benefit liabilities
* (1) In addition to benefits paid under the preceding provisions of this section with respect to a terminated plan, the corporation shall pay the portion of the amount determined under paragraph (2) which is allocated with respect to each participant under section 1344(a) of this title. Such payment shall be made to such participant or to such participant's beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title).

* (2) The amount determined under this paragraph is an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying—

  * (A) the outstanding amount of benefit liabilities under the plan (including interest calculated from the termination date), by

  * (B) the applicable recovery ratio.


* (3)(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the term "recovery ratio" means the ratio which—

  * (i) the sum of the values of all recoveries under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, determined by the corporation in connection with plan terminations described under subparagraph (B), bears to

  * (ii) the sum of all unfunded benefit liabilities under such plans as of the termination date in connection with any such prior termination.


* (B) A plan termination described in this subparagraph is a termination with respect to which—

  * (i) the corporation has determined the value of recoveries under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, and

  * (ii) notices of intent to terminate were provided (or in the case of a termination by the corporation, a notice of determination under section 1342 of this title was issued) during the 5-Federal fiscal year period ending with the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which occurs the date of the notice of intent to terminate (or the notice of determination under section 1342 of this title) with respect to the plan termination for which the recovery ratio is being determined.


* (C) In the case of a terminated plan with respect to which the outstanding amount of benefit liabilities exceeds $20,000,000, for purposes of this section, the term "recovery ratio" means, with respect to the termination of such plan, the ratio of—

  * (i) the value of the recoveries of the corporation under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title in connection with such plan, to

  * (ii) the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under such plan as of the termination date.


* (4) Determinations under this subsection shall be made by the corporation. Such determinations shall be binding unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to be unreasonable.

#### (d) Authorization to guarantee other classes of benefits
* The corporation is authorized to guarantee the payment of such other classes of benefits and to establish the terms and conditions under which such other classes of benefits are guaranteed as it determines to be appropriate.

#### (e) Nonforfeitability of preretirement survivor annuity
* For purposes of subsection (a), a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined in section 1055(e)(1) of this title) with respect to a participant under a terminated single-employer plan shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the termination date.

#### (f) Effective date of plan amendments
* For purposes of this section, the effective date of a plan amendment described in section 1054(i)(1) of this title shall be the effective date of the plan of reorganization of the employer described in section 1054(i)(1) of this title or, if later, the effective date stated in such amendment.

#### (g) Bankruptcy filing substituted for termination date
* If a contributing sponsor of a plan has filed or has had filed against such person a petition seeking liquidation or reorganization in a case under title 11 or under any similar Federal law or law of a State or political subdivision, and the case has not been dismissed as of the termination date of the plan, then this section shall be applied by treating the date such petition was filed as the termination date of the plan.

#### (h) Special rule for plans electing certain funding requirements
* If any plan makes an election under section 402(a)(1) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and is terminated effective before the end of the 10-year period beginning on the first day of the first applicable plan year—

  * (1) this section shall be applied—

    * (A) by treating the first day of the first applicable plan year as the termination date of the plan, and

    * (B) by determining the amount of guaranteed benefits on the basis of plan assets and liabilities as of such assumed termination date, and


  * (2) notwithstanding section 1344(a) of this title, plan assets shall first be allocated to pay the amount, if any, by which—

    * (A) the amount of guaranteed benefits under this section (determined without regard to paragraph (1) and on the basis of plan assets and liabilities as of the actual date of plan termination), exceeds

    * (B) the amount determined under paragraph (1).

### §1322a. Multiemployer plan benefits guaranteed
#### (a) Benefits of covered plans subject to guarantee
* The corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a multiemployer plan—

* (B) For purposes of this section, a benefit or benefit increase which has been in effect under a plan for less than 60 months before the first day of the plan year for which an amendment reducing the benefit or the benefit increase is taken into account under section 1425(a)(2) of this title in determining the minimum contribution requirement for the plan year under section 1423(b) of this title is not eligible for the corporation's guarantee.

* (2) For purposes of this section—

    * (i) the date on which the documents establishing or increasing the benefit were executed, or

    * (ii) the effective date of the benefit or benefit increase;


  * (B) the period of time for which a benefit or a benefit increase has been in effect under a successor plan includes the period of time for which the benefit or benefit increase was in effect under a previously established plan; and

#### (c) Determinations respecting amount of guarantee
* (1) Except as provided in subsection (g), the monthly benefit of a participant or a beneficiary which is guaranteed under this section by the corporation with respect to a plan is the product of—

  * (A) 100 percent of the accrual rate up to $11, plus 75 percent of the lesser of—

    * (i) $33, or

    * (ii) the accrual rate, if any, in excess of $11, and


  * (B) the number of the participant's years of credited service.

    * (i) no greater than the monthly benefit which would be payable under the plan at normal retirement age in the form of a single life annuity, and

    * (ii) determined without regard to any reduction under section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26; divided by


  * (B) the participant's years of credited service.


* (3) For purposes of this subsection—

  * (A) a year of credited service is a year in which the participant completed—

    * (i) a full year of participation in the plan, or

    * (ii) any period of service before participation which is credited for purposes of benefit accrual as the equivalent of a full year of participation;


  * (B) any year for which the participant is credited for purposes of benefit accrual with a fraction of the equivalent of a full year of participation shall be counted as such a fraction of a year of credited service; and

  * (C) years of credited service shall be determined by including service which may otherwise be disregarded by the plan under section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26.


* (4) For purposes of subsection (a), in the case of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined in section 1055(e)(1) of this title) payable to the surviving spouse of a participant under a multiemployer plan which becomes insolvent under section 1426(b) of this title or 1441(d)(2) of this title or is terminated, such annuity shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the date on which the plan became so insolvent or the termination date.

#### (d) Amount of guarantee of reduced benefit
* In the case of a benefit which has been reduced under section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26, the corporation shall guarantee the lesser of—

  * (A) conduct a study to determine—

    * (i) the premiums needed to maintain the basic-benefit guarantee levels for multiemployer plans described in subsection (c), and

  * (ii) a revised schedule of basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans which is necessary to support the existing basic-benefit guarantees for such plans, and

  * (iii) a revised schedule of basic-benefit guarantees for multiemployer plans for which the schedule of premiums necessary is higher than the existing premium schedule for such plans but lower than the revised schedule of premiums for such plans specified in clause (ii), together with such schedule of premiums.


* (B) The revised schedule of increased premiums referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (A)(iii) shall go into effect as approved by the enactment of a joint resolution.

Such subparagraphs shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.

#### (g) Guarantee of payment of other classes of benefits and establishment of terms and conditions of guarantee; promulgation of regulations for establishment of supplemental program to guarantee benefits otherwise ineligible; status of benefits; applicability of revised schedule of premiums
* (1) The corporation may guarantee the payment of such other classes of benefits under multiemployer plans, and establish the terms and conditions under which those other classes of benefits are guaranteed, as it determines to be appropriate.

* (2)(A) The corporation shall prescribe regulations to establish a supplemental program to guarantee benefits under multiemployer plans which would be guaranteed under this section but for the limitations in subsection (c). Such regulations shall be proposed by the corporation no later than the end of the 18th calendar month following September 26, 1980. The regulations shall make coverage under the supplemental program available no later than January 1, 1983. Any election to participate in the supplemental program shall be on a voluntary basis, and a plan electing such coverage shall continue to pay the premiums required under section 1306(a)(2)(B) of this title to the revolving fund used pursuant to section 1305 of this title in connection with benefits otherwise guaranteed under this section.

* (B) The regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall provide—

  * (i) that a plan must elect coverage under the supplemental program within the time permitted by the regulations;

  * (ii) unless the corporation determines otherwise, that a plan may not elect supplemental coverage unless the value of the assets of the plan as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the election must be made is an amount equal to 15 times the total amount of the benefit payments made under the plan for that year; and

  * (iii) such other reasonable terms and conditions for supplemental coverage, including funding standards and any other reasonable limitations with respect to plans or benefits covered or to means of program financing, as the corporation determines are necessary and appropriate for a feasible supplemental program consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.


* (3) Any benefits guaranteed under this subsection shall be considered nonbasic benefits for purposes of this subchapter.

* (4)(A) No revised schedule of premiums under this subsection, after the initial schedule, shall go into effect unless—

  * (i) the revised schedule is submitted to the Congress, and

  * (ii) a joint resolution described in subparagraph (B) is not enacted before the close of the 60th legislative day after such schedule is submitted to the Congress.
