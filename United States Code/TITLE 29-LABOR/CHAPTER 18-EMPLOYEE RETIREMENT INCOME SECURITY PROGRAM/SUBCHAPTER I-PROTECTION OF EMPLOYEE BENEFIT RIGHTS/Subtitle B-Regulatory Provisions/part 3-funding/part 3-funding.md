#### (a) Requirement to meet minimum funding standard
* #### (1) In general
  * A plan to which this part applies shall satisfy the minimum funding standard applicable to the plan for any plan year.

* #### (2) Minimum funding standard
  * For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan shall be treated as satisfying the minimum funding standard for a plan year if—

    * (A) in the case of a defined benefit plan which is a single-employer plan (other than a CSEC plan), the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which, in the aggregate, are not less than the minimum required contribution determined under section 1083 of this title for the plan for the plan year,

* #### (3) Multiemployer plans in critical status
  * Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a multiemployer plan for any plan year in which the plan is in critical status pursuant to section 1085 of this title. This paragraph shall only apply if the plan sponsor adopts a rehabilitation plan in accordance with section 1085(e) of this title and complies with the terms of such rehabilitation plan (and any updates or modifications of the plan).

#### (c) Variance from minimum funding standards
* #### (1) Waiver in case of business hardship
  * #### (A) In general
    * If—

      * (i) an employer is (or in the case of a multiemployer plan or a CSEC plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan are) unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan), and

      * (ii) application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate,


  * the Secretary of the Treasury may, subject to subparagraph (C), waive the requirements of subsection (a) for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not waive the minimum funding standard with respect to a plan for more than 3 of any 15 (5 of any 15 in the case of a multiemployer plan) consecutive plan years.

  * #### (B) Effects of waiver
    * If a waiver is granted under subparagraph (A) for any plan year—

      * (ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the funding standard account shall be credited under section 1084(b)(3)(C) of this title with the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1084(b)(2)(C) of this title, and

      * (iii) in the case of a CSEC plan, the funding standard account shall be credited under section 1085a(b)(3)(C) of this title with the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1085a(b)(2)(C) of this title.

  * #### (C) Waiver of amortized portion not allowed

      * Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Secretary of the Treasury may require an employer maintaining a defined benefit plan which is a single-employer plan (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(15) of this title) to provide security to such plan as a condition for granting or modifying a waiver under paragraph (1) or for granting an extension under section 1085a(d) of this title.

    * #### (ii) Special rules
      * Any security provided under clause (i) may be perfected and enforced only by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or at the direction of the Corporation, by a contributing sponsor (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(13) of this title), or a member of such sponsor's controlled group (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(14) of this title).

  * #### (B) Consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
    * Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting or modifying a waiver under this subsection or an extension under 1085a(d) of this title with respect to a plan described in subparagraph (A)(i)—

  * #### (B) Special rule if employer is member of controlled group
    * In the case of a single-employer plan, if an employer is a member of a controlled group, the temporary substantial business hardship requirements of paragraph (1) shall be treated as met only if such requirements are met—

      * (i) with respect to such employer, and

      * (ii) with respect to the controlled group of which such employer is a member (determined by treating all members of such group as a single employer).


  * The Secretary of the Treasury may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if such Secretary determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this paragraph.

* #### (6) Advance notice
  * #### (A) In general
    * The Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting a waiver under this subsection, require each applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to such Secretary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such waiver to each affected party (as defined in section 1301(a)(21) of this title).

  * #### (A) In general
    * No amendment of a plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan shall be adopted if a waiver under this subsection or an extension of time under section 1084(d) of this title or section 1085a(d) of this title is in effect with respect to the plan, or if a plan amendment described in subsection (d)(2) which reduces the accrued benefit of any participant has been made at any time in the preceding 12 months (24 months in the case of a multiemployer plan). If a plan is amended in violation of the preceding sentence, any such waiver, or extension of time, shall not apply to any plan year ending on or after the date on which such amendment is adopted.

  * #### (B) Exception
    * Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any plan amendment which—

      * (ii) only repeals an amendment described in subsection (d)(2), or

      * (iii) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.

    * (B) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the beginning of the first plan year to which the amendment applies, and

    * (C) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the time of adoption except to the extent required by the circumstances,


* shall, at the election of the plan administrator, be deemed to have been made on the first day of such plan year. No amendment described in this paragraph which reduces the accrued benefits of any participant shall take effect unless the plan administrator files a notice with the Secretary of the Treasury notifying him of such amendment and such Secretary has approved such amendment, or within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, failed to disapprove such amendment. No amendment described in this subsection shall be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury unless such Secretary determines that such amendment is necessary because of a temporary substantial business hardship (as determined under subsection (c)(2)) or a substantial business hardship (as so determined) in the case of a multiemployer plan and that a waiver under subsection (c) (or, in the case of a multiemployer plan or a CSEC plan, any extension of the amortization period under section 1084(d) of this title or section 1085a(d) of this title) is unavailable or inadequate.

    * #### (vi) Reporting
      * A plan sponsor of a plan who makes an election under clause (i) shall—

* #### (7) Increases in alternate required installments in cases of excess compensation or extraordinary dividends or stock redemptions
  * #### (A) In general
    * If there is an installment acceleration amount with respect to a plan for any plan year in the restriction period with respect to an election year under paragraph (2)(D), then the shortfall amortization installment otherwise determined and payable under such paragraph for such plan year shall, subject to the limitation under subparagraph (B), be increased by such amount.

    * #### (iii) Carryover of excess installment acceleration amounts
      * #### (I) In general
        * If the installment acceleration amount for any plan year (determined without regard to clause (ii)) exceeds the limitation under clause (ii), then, subject to subclause (II), such excess shall be treated as an installment acceleration amount with respect to the succeeding plan year.

An amount to which the preceding sentence applies shall not be taken into account under this paragraph for any subsequent calendar year.

    * #### (iii) Only remuneration for certain post-2009 services counted
      * Remuneration shall be taken into account under clause (i) only to the extent attributable to services performed by the employee for the plan sponsor after February 28, 2010.

        * (II) the minimum required contribution for such preceding plan year.

    * #### (ii) Adjustments for interest
      * Any excess contributions under clause (i) shall be properly adjusted for interest accruing for the periods between the first day of the current plan year and the dates on which the excess contributions were made, determined by using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year and by treating contributions as being first used to satisfy the minimum required contribution.

    * #### (iii) Certain contributions necessary to avoid benefit limitations disregarded
      * The excess described in clause (i) with respect to any preceding plan year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of contributions an employer would be required to make under paragraph (1), (2), or (4) of section 1056(g) of this title to avoid a benefit limitation which would otherwise be imposed under such paragraph for the preceding plan year. Any contribution which may be taken into account in satisfying the requirements of more than 1 of such paragraphs shall be taken into account only once for purposes of this clause.

      * (ii) as of the time specified in paragraph (5)(A), any reduction in such balance elected under paragraph (5).

* #### (8) Adjustments for investment experience
  * In determining the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance of a plan as of the first day of the plan year, the plan sponsor shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, adjust such balance to reflect the rate of return on plan assets for the preceding plan year. Notwithstanding subsection (g)(3), such rate of return shall be determined on the basis of fair market value and shall properly take into account, in accordance with such regulations, all contributions, distributions, and other plan payments made during such period.

* #### (9) Elections
  * Elections under this subsection shall be made at such times, and in such form and manner, as shall be prescribed in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury.

    * For purposes of this paragraph—

    * #### (i) Plans not in existence in preceding year
      * In the case of the first plan year of any plan, subparagraph (B) shall apply to such plan by taking into account the number of participants that the plan is reasonably expected to have on days during such first plan year.

  * #### (A) In general
    * Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the value of plan assets shall be the fair market value of the assets.

  * #### (B) Averaging allowed
    * A plan may determine the value of plan assets on the basis of the averaging of fair market values, but only if such method—

      * (i) is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury,

      * (ii) does not provide for averaging of such values over more than the period beginning on the last day of the 25th month preceding the month in which the valuation date occurs and ending on the valuation date (or a similar period in the case of a valuation date which is not the 1st day of a month), and

      * (iii) does not result in a determination of the value of plan assets which, at any time, is lower than 90 percent or greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time.


  * Any such averaging shall be adjusted for contributions, distributions, and expected earnings (as determined by the plan's actuary on the basis of an assumed earnings rate specified by the actuary but not in excess of the third segment rate applicable under subsection (h)(2)(C)(iii)), as specified by the Secretary of the Treasury.

* #### (4) Accounting for contribution receipts
  * For purposes of determining the value of assets under paragraph (3)—

  * #### (A) Prior year contributions
    * If—

      * (i) an employer makes any contribution to the plan after the valuation date for the plan year in which the contribution is made, and

      * (ii) the contribution is for a preceding plan year,


  * the contribution shall be taken into account as an asset of the plan as of the valuation date, except that in the case of any plan year beginning after 2008, only the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of such contribution may be taken into account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, present value shall be determined using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year to which the contribution is properly allocable.

  * #### (B) Special rule for current year contributions made before valuation date
    * If any contributions for any plan year are made to or under the plan during the plan year but before the valuation date for the plan year, the assets of the plan as of the valuation date shall not include—

#### (h) Actuarial assumptions and methods
* #### (1) In general
  * Subject to this subsection, the determination of any present value or other computation under this section shall be made on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods—

    * (A) each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and

    * (B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.

* #### (2) Interest rates
  * #### (A) Effective interest rate
    * For purposes of this section, the term "effective interest rate" means, with respect to any plan for any plan year, the single rate of interest which, if used to determine the present value of the plan's accrued or earned benefits referred to in subsection (d)(1), would result in an amount equal to the funding target of the plan for such plan year.

  * #### (B) Interest rates for determining funding target
    * For purposes of determining the funding target and normal cost of a plan for any plan year, the interest rate used in determining the present value of the benefits of the plan shall be—

      * (ii) in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable during the 15-year period beginning at the end of the period described in clause (i), the second segment rate with respect to the applicable month, and

      * (iii) in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable after the period described in clause (ii), the third segment rate with respect to the applicable month.

  * #### (C) Segment rates

    * #### (ii) Second segment rate
      * The term "second segment rate" means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during the 15-year period beginning at the end of the period described in clause (i).

    * #### (iii) Third segment rate
      * The term "third segment rate" means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during periods beginning after the period described in clause (ii).

    * #### (iv) Segment rate stabilization
      * #### (I) In general
        * If a segment rate described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) with respect to any applicable month (determined without regard to this clause) is less than the applicable minimum percentage, or more than the applicable maximum percentage, of the average of the segment rates described in such clause for years in the 25-year period ending with September 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the plan year begins, then the segment rate described in such clause with respect to the applicable month shall be equal to the applicable minimum percentage or the applicable maximum percentage of such average, whichever is closest. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine such average on an annual basis and may prescribe equivalent rates for years in any such 25-year period for which the rates described in any such clause are not available.

      * #### (II) Applicable minimum percentage; applicable maximum percentage

### §1084. Minimum funding standards for multiemployer plans
#### (a) In general
* For purposes of section 1082 of this title, the accumulated funding deficiency of a multiemployer plan for any plan year is the amount, determined as of the end of the plan year, equal to the excess (if any) of the total charges to the funding standard account of the plan for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year for which this part applies to the plan) over the total credits to such account for such years.

#### (b) Funding standard account
* #### (1) Account required
  * Each multiemployer plan to which this part applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.

* #### (2) Charges to account
  * For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of—

    * (A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,

    * (B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)—

      * (i) in the case of a plan which comes into existence on or after January 1, 2008, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this section applies, over a period of 15 plan years,

      * (ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 15 plan years,

      * (iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 15 plan years, and

    * (D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under section 1082(b)(3)(D) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006), and

    * (E) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 20 years the contributions which would be required to be made under the plan but for the provisions of section 1082(c)(7)(A)(i)(I) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006).

* #### (3) Credits to account
  * For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of—

    * (A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,

    * (B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)—

      * (i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 15 plan years,

      * (ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 15 plan years, and

      * (iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 15 plan years,


    * (C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1082(c)(3) of this title) for the plan year, and

    * (D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standard under section 1085 of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006), the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.

* #### (4) Special rule for amounts first amortized in plan years before 2008
  * In the case of any amount amortized under section 1082(b) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006) over any period beginning with a plan year beginning before 2008, in lieu of the amortization described in paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B), such amount shall continue to be amortized under such section as so in effect.

* #### (5) Combining and offsetting amounts to be amortized
  * Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be—

    * (A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and

    * (B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.

* #### (6) Interest
  * The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.

* #### (7) Special rules relating to charges and credits to funding standard account
  * For purposes of this part—

  * #### (A) Withdrawal liability
    * Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.

  * #### (B) Adjustments when a multiemployer plan leaves reorganization
    * If a multiemployer plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year—

      * (i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but

      * (ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.


  * The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 1423(a) of this title as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.

  * #### (C) Plan payments to supplemental program or withdrawal liability payment fund
    * Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to section 1402 of this title or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) of title 26 pursuant to section 1403 of this title shall reduce the amount of contributions considered received by the plan for the plan year.

  * #### (D) Interim withdrawal liability payments
    * Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

  * #### (E) Election for deferral of charge for portion of net experience loss
    * If an election is in effect under section 1082(b)(7)(F) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006) for any plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged in the plan year to which the portion of the net experience loss deferred by such election was deferred with the amount so deferred (and paragraph (2)(B)(iii) shall not apply to the amount so charged).

  * #### (F) Financial assistance
    * Any amount of any financial assistance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to any plan, and any repayment of such amount, shall be taken into account under this section and section 1082 of this title in such manner as is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

  * #### (G) Short-term benefits
    * To the extent that any plan amendment increases the unfunded past service liability under the plan by reason of an increase in benefits which are not payable as a life annuity but are payable under the terms of the plan for a period that does not exceed 14 years from the effective date of the amendment, paragraph (2)(B)(ii) shall be applied separately with respect to such increase in unfunded past service liability by substituting the number of years of the period during which such benefits are payable for "15".

* #### (8) Special relief rules
  * Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection—

  * #### (A) Amortization of net investment losses
    * #### (i) In general
      * A multiemployer plan with respect to which the solvency test under subparagraph (C) is met may treat the portion of any experience loss or gain attributable to net investment losses incurred in either or both of the first two plan years ending after August 31, 2008, as an item separate from other experience losses, to be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over the period—

        * (I) beginning with the plan year in which such portion is first recognized in the actuarial value of assets, and

        * (II) ending with the last plan year in the 30-plan year period beginning with the plan year in which such net investment loss was incurred.

    * #### (ii) Coordination with extensions
      * If this subparagraph applies for any plan year—

        * (I) no extension of the amortization period under clause (i) shall be allowed under subsection (d), and

        * (II) if an extension was granted under subsection (d) for any plan year before the election to have this subparagraph apply to the plan year, such extension shall not result in such amortization period exceeding 30 years.

    * #### (iii) Net investment losses
      * For purposes of this subparagraph—

      * #### (I) In general
        * Net investment losses shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the difference between actual and expected returns (including any difference attributable to any criminally fraudulent investment arrangement).

      * #### (II) Criminally fraudulent investment arrangements
        * The determination as to whether an arrangement is a criminally fraudulent investment arrangement shall be made under rules substantially similar to the rules prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of section 165 of title 26.

  * #### (B) Expanded smoothing period
    * #### (i) In general
      * A multiemployer plan with respect to which the solvency test under subparagraph (C) is met may change its asset valuation method in a manner which—

        * (I) spreads the difference between expected and actual returns for either or both of the first 2 plan years ending after August 31, 2008, over a period of not more than 10 years,

        * (II) provides that for either or both of the first 2 plan years beginning after August 31, 2008, the value of plan assets at any time shall not be less than 80 percent or greater than 130 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time, or

        * (III) makes both changes described in subclauses (I) and (II) to such method.

    * #### (ii) Asset valuation methods
      * If this subparagraph applies for any plan year—

        * (I) the Secretary of the Treasury shall not treat the asset valuation method of the plan as unreasonable solely because of the changes in such method described in clause (i), and

        * (II) such changes shall be deemed approved by such Secretary under section 1082(d)(1) of this title and section 412(d)(1) of title 26.

    * #### (iii) Amortization of reduction in unfunded accrued liability
      * If this subparagraph and subparagraph (A) both apply for any plan year, the plan shall treat any reduction in unfunded accrued liability resulting from the application of this subparagraph as a separate experience amortization base, to be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 30 plan years rather than the period such liability would otherwise be amortized over.

  * #### (C) Solvency test
    * The solvency test under this paragraph is met only if the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay expected benefits and anticipated expenditures over the amortization period, taking into account the changes in the funding standard account under this paragraph.

  * #### (D) Restriction on benefit increases
    * If subparagraph (A) or (B) apply to a multiemployer plan for any plan year, then, in addition to any other applicable restrictions on benefit increases, a plan amendment increasing benefits may not go into effect during either of the 2 plan years immediately following such plan year unless—

      * (i) the plan actuary certifies that—

        * (I) any such increase is paid for out of additional contributions not allocated to the plan immediately before the application of this paragraph to the plan, and

        * (II) the plan's funded percentage and projected credit balances for such 2 plan years are reasonably expected to be at least as high as such percentage and balances would have been if the benefit increase had not been adopted, or


      * (ii) the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law.

  * #### (E) Reporting
    * A plan sponsor of a plan to which this paragraph applies shall—

      * (i) give notice of such application to participants and beneficiaries of the plan, and

      * (ii) inform the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of such application in such form and manner as the Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation may prescribe.

#### (c) Additional rules

  * For purposes of this part, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.

* #### (2) Valuation of assets
  * #### (A) In general
    * For purposes of this part, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

  * #### (B) Election with respect to bonds
    * The value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of such Secretary.

* #### (3) Actuarial assumptions must be reasonable
  * For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods—

    * (B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.

* #### (4) Treatment of certain changes as experience gain or loss
  * For purposes of this section, if—

    * (A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or

    * (B) a change in the definition of the term "wages" under section 3121 of title 26, or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5) of title 26,


* results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.

* #### (5) Full funding
  * If, as of the close of a plan year, a plan would (without regard to this paragraph) have an accumulated funding deficiency in excess of the full funding limitation—

    * (A) the funding standard account shall be credited with the amount of such excess, and

    * (B) all amounts described in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) of subsection (b) (2) and subparagraph (B) of subsection (b)(3) which are required to be amortized shall be considered fully amortized for purposes of such subparagraphs.

* #### (6) Full-funding limitation
  * #### (A) In general
    * For purposes of paragraph (5), the term "full-funding limitation" means the excess (if any) of—

      * (i) the accrued liability (including normal cost) under the plan (determined under the entry age normal funding method if such accrued liability cannot be directly calculated under the funding method used for the plan), over

      * (ii) the lesser of—

        * (I) the fair market value of the plan's assets, or

        * (II) the value of such assets determined under paragraph (2).

  * #### (B) Minimum amount
    * #### (i) In general
      * In no event shall the full-funding limitation determined under subparagraph (A) be less than the excess (if any) of—

        * (I) 90 percent of the current liability of the plan (including the expected increase in current liability due to benefits accruing during the plan year), over

        * (II) the value of the plan's assets determined under paragraph (2).

    * #### (ii) Assets
      * For purposes of clause (i), assets shall not be reduced by any credit balance in the funding standard account.

  * &nbsp;shall not be taken into account until the event on which the benefit is contingent occurs.

    * #### (iii) Interest rate used
      * The rate of interest used to determine current liability under this paragraph shall be the rate of interest determined under subparagraph (E).

    * #### (iv) Mortality tables
      * #### (I) Commissioners' standard table
        * In the case of plan years beginning before the first plan year to which the first tables prescribed under subclause (II) apply, the mortality table used in determining current liability under this paragraph shall be the table prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury which is based on the prevailing commissioners' standard table (described in section 807(d)(5)(A) of title 26) used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on January 1, 1993.

      * #### (II) Secretarial authority
        * The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation prescribe for plan years beginning after December 31, 1999, mortality tables to be used in determining current liability under this subsection. Such tables shall be based upon the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience. In prescribing such tables, such Secretary shall take into account results of available independent studies of mortality of individuals covered by pension plans.

    * #### (v) Separate mortality tables for the disabled
      * Notwithstanding clause (iv)—

      * #### (I) In general
        * The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish mortality tables which may be used (in lieu of the tables under clause (iv)) to determine current liability under this subsection for individuals who are entitled to benefits under the plan on account of disability. Such Secretary shall establish separate tables for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning before January 1, 1995, and for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning on or after such date.

      * #### (II) Special rule for disabilities occurring after 1994
        * In the case of disabilities occurring in plan years beginning after December 31, 1994, the tables under subclause (I) shall apply only with respect to individuals described in such subclause who are disabled within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] and the regulations thereunder.

    * #### (vi) Periodic review
      * The Secretary of the Treasury shall periodically (at least every 5 years) review any tables in effect under this subparagraph and shall, to the extent such Secretary determines necessary, by regulation update the tables to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.

    * For purposes of determining a plan's current liability for purposes of this paragraph—

    * #### (i) In general
      * If any rate of interest used under the plan under subsection (b)(6) to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall establish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.

      * For purposes of this subparagraph—

      * #### (I) In general
        * Except as provided in subclause (II), the term "permissible range" means a rate of interest which is not more than 5 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the weighted average of the rates of interest on 30-year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.

      * #### (II) Secretarial authority
        * If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, such Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under such subclause.

    * #### (iii) Assumptions
      * Notwithstanding paragraph (3)(A), the interest rate used under the plan shall be—

        * (I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but

        * (II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.

* #### (7) Annual valuation
  * #### (A) In general
    * For purposes of this section, a determination of experience gains and losses and a valuation of the plan's liability shall be made not less frequently than once every year, except that such determination shall be made more frequently to the extent required in particular cases under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

  * #### (B) Valuation date
    * #### (i) Current year
      * Except as provided in clause (ii), the valuation referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be made as of a date within the plan year to which the valuation refers or within one month prior to the beginning of such year.

    * #### (ii) Use of prior year valuation
      * The valuation referred to in subparagraph (A) may be made as of a date within the plan year prior to the year to which the valuation refers if, as of such date, the value of the assets of the plan are not less than 100 percent of the plan's current liability (as defined in paragraph (6)(D) without regard to clause (iv) thereof).

    * #### (iii) Adjustments
      * Information under clause (ii) shall, in accordance with regulations, be actuarially adjusted to reflect significant differences in participants.

    * #### (iv) Limitation
      * A change in funding method to use a prior year valuation, as provided in clause (ii), may not be made unless as of the valuation date within the prior plan year, the value of the assets of the plan are not less than 125 percent of the plan's current liability (as defined in paragraph (6)(D) without regard to clause (iv) thereof).

* #### (8) Time when certain contributions deemed made
  * For purposes of this section, any contributions for a plan year made by an employer after the last day of such plan year, but not later than two and one-half months after such day, shall be deemed to have been made on such last day. For purposes of this subparagraph, such two and one-half month period may be extended for not more than six months under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

* #### (1) Automatic extension upon application by certain plans
  * #### (A) In general
    * If the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan—

    * If the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan submits to the Secretary of the Treasury an application for an extension of the period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B) or described in subsection (b)(4), the Secretary of the Treasury may extend the amortization period for a period of time (not in excess of 10 years reduced by the number of years of any extension under paragraph (1) with respect to such unfunded liability) if the Secretary of the Treasury makes the determination described in subparagraph (B). Such extension shall be in addition to any extension under paragraph (1).

  * #### (B) Determination
    * The Secretary of the Treasury may grant an extension under subparagraph (A) if such Secretary determines that—

      * (i) such extension would carry out the purposes of this chapter and would provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and

      * (ii) the failure to permit such extension would—

        * (I) result in a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation, and

        * (II) be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate.

  * #### (C) Action by Secretary of the Treasury
    * The Secretary of the Treasury shall act upon any application for an extension under this paragraph within 180 days of the submission of such application. If such Secretary rejects the application for an extension under this paragraph, such Secretary shall provide notice to the plan detailing the specific reasons for the rejection, including references to the criteria set forth above.

* #### (3) Advance notice
  * #### (A) In general

The actuary's projections shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either—

        * (I) the actuarial statement required under section 1023(d) of this title with respect to the most recently filed annual report, or

        * (II) the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.

    * #### (ii) Determinations of future contributions
      * Any actuarial projection of plan assets shall assume—

        * (I) reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current and succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of the one or more collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years, or

        * (II) that employer contributions for the most recent plan year will continue indefinitely, but only if the plan actuary determines there have been no significant demographic changes that would make such assumption unreasonable.

    * #### (iii) Projected industry activity
      * Any projection of activity in the industry or industries covered by the plan, including future covered employment and contribution levels, shall be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which shall act reasonably and in good faith.

      * Clauses (i) and (ii) (other than the 2nd sentence of clause (i)) may be disregarded by a plan actuary in the case of any certification of whether a plan will be in critical status in a succeeding plan year, except that a plan sponsor may not elect to be in critical status for a plan year under paragraph (4) in any case in which the certification upon which such election would be based is made without regard to such clauses.

    * #### (iv) Projections of critical and declining status
      * In determining whether a plan is in critical and declining status as described in subsection (e)(9), clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall apply, except that—

        * (I) if reasonable, the plan actuary shall assume that each contributing employer in compliance continues to comply through the end of the rehabilitation period or such later time as provided in subsection (e)(3)(A)(ii) with the terms of the rehabilitation plan that correspond to the schedule adopted or imposed under subsection (e), and

        * (II) the plan actuary shall take into account any suspensions of benefits described in subsection (e)(9) adopted in a prior plan year that are still in effect.

  * #### (C) Penalty for failure to secure timely actuarial certification
    * Any failure of the plan's actuary to certify the plan's status under this subsection by the date specified in subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of section 1132(c)(2) of this title as a failure or refusal by the plan administrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under section 1021(b)(1) of this title.

    * (B) within 30 days after the adoption of the funding improvement plan—

      * (i) shall provide to the bargaining parties 1 or more schedules showing revised benefit structures, revised contribution structures, or both, which, if adopted, may reasonably be expected to enable the multiemployer plan to meet the applicable benchmarks in accordance with the funding improvement plan, including—

        * (I) one proposal for reductions in the amount of future benefit accruals necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks, assuming no amendments increasing contributions under the plan (other than amendments increasing contributions necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks after amendments have reduced future benefit accruals to the maximum extent permitted by law), and

        * (II) one proposal for increases in contributions under the plan necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks, assuming no amendments reducing future benefit accruals under the plan, and


      * (ii) may, if the plan sponsor deems appropriate, prepare and provide the bargaining parties with additional information relating to contribution rates or benefit reductions, alternative schedules, or other information relevant to achieving the applicable benchmarks in accordance with the funding improvement plan.

      * If the plan's actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is no longer in endangered status and is not in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the preceding plan year.

    * #### (ii) Plans in critical status
      * If the plan's actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the plan year preceding the first plan year in the rehabilitation period with respect to such status.

  * #### (D) Plans in endangered status at end of period
    * If the plan's actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the first plan year following the close of the period described in subparagraph (A) that the plan is in endangered status, the provisions of this subsection and subsection (d) shall be applied as if such first plan year were an initial determination year, except that the plan may not be amended in a manner inconsistent with the funding improvement plan in effect for the preceding plan year until a new funding improvement plan is adopted.

      * (ii) after receiving one or more updated schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (6)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the updated funding improvement plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,


  * then the contribution schedule applicable under the expired collective bargaining agreement, as updated and in effect on the date the collective bargaining agreement expires, shall be implemented by the plan sponsor beginning on the date specified in subparagraph (C).

  * #### (C) Date of implementation

          * (aa) the plan is not projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under section 1084(d)(1) of this title; and

          * (bb) the plan is not projected to become insolvent within the meaning of section 1426 of this title for any of the 30 succeeding plan years,


  * &nbsp;regardless of whether the plan is described in one or more of the subparagraphs in subsection (b)(2) as of the beginning of the plan year.

      * #### (II) Reentry into critical status
        * A plan that emerges from critical status under subclause (I) shall not reenter critical status for any subsequent plan year unless—

          * (aa) the plan is projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under section 1084(d) of this title; or

* #### (5) Rehabilitation plan adoption period
  * For purposes of this section, the term "rehabilitation plan adoption period" means the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial critical year and ending on the day before the first day of the rehabilitation period.

* #### (6) Limitation on reduction in rates of future accruals
  * Any reduction in the rate of future accruals under the default schedule described in the last sentence of paragraph (1) shall not reduce the rate of future accruals below—

    * (A) a monthly benefit (payable as a single life annuity commencing at the participant's normal retirement age) equal to 1 percent of the contributions required to be made with respect to a participant, or the equivalent standard accrual rate for a participant or group of participants under the collective bargaining agreements in effect as of the first day of the initial critical year, or

    * (B) if lower, the accrual rate under the plan on such first day.


* The equivalent standard accrual rate shall be determined by the plan sponsor based on the standard or average contribution base units which the plan sponsor determines to be representative for active participants and such other factors as the plan sponsor determines to be relevant. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the ability of the plan sponsor to prepare and provide the bargaining parties with alternative schedules to the default schedule that establish lower or higher accrual and contribution rates than the rates otherwise described in this paragraph.

* #### (7) Automatic employer surcharge
  * #### (A) Imposition of surcharge
    * Each employer otherwise obligated to make contributions for the initial critical year shall be obligated to pay to the plan for such year a surcharge equal to 5 percent of the contributions otherwise required under the applicable collective bargaining agreement (or other agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes). For each succeeding plan year in which the plan is in critical status for a consecutive period of years beginning with the initial critical year, the surcharge shall be 10 percent of the contributions otherwise so required.

  * #### (B) Enforcement of surcharge
    * The surcharges under subparagraph (A) shall be due and payable on the same schedule as the contributions on which the surcharges are based. Any failure to make a surcharge payment shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under section 1145 of this title and shall be enforceable as such.

  * #### (C) Surcharge to terminate upon collective bargaining agreement renegotiation
    * The surcharge under this paragraph shall cease to be effective with respect to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (or other agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes), beginning on the effective date of a collective bargaining agreement (or other such agreement) that includes terms consistent with a schedule presented by the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B)(i), as modified under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3).

  * #### (D) Surcharge not to apply until employer receives notice
    * The surcharge under this paragraph shall not apply to an employer until 30 days after the employer has been notified by the plan sponsor that the plan is in critical status and that the surcharge is in effect.

  * #### (E) Surcharge not to generate increased benefit accruals
    * Notwithstanding any provision of a plan to the contrary, the amount of any surcharge under this paragraph shall not be the basis for any benefit accrual under the plan.

* #### (8) Benefit adjustments
  * #### (A) Adjustable benefits
    * #### (i) In general
      * Notwithstanding section 1054(g) of this title, the plan sponsor shall, subject to the notice requirements in subparagraph (C), make any reductions to adjustable benefits which the plan sponsor deems appropriate, based upon the outcome of collective bargaining over the schedule or schedules provided under paragraph (1)(B)(i).

    * #### (ii) Exception for retirees
      * Except in the case of adjustable benefits described in clause (iv)(III), the plan sponsor of a plan in critical status shall not reduce adjustable benefits of any participant or beneficiary whose benefit commencement date is before the date on which the plan provides notice to the participant or beneficiary under subsection (b)(3)(D) for the initial critical year.

    * #### (iii) Plan sponsor flexibility
      * The plan sponsor shall include in the schedules provided to the bargaining parties an allowance for funding the benefits of participants with respect to whom contributions are not currently required to be made, and shall reduce their benefits to the extent permitted under this subchapter and considered appropriate by the plan sponsor based on the plan's then current overall funding status.

    * #### (iv) Adjustable benefit defined
      * For purposes of this paragraph, the term "adjustable benefit" means—

        * (II) any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy (within the meaning of section 1054(g)(2)(A) of this title) and any benefit payment option (other than the qualified joint and survivor annuity), and

        * (III) benefit increases that would not be eligible for a guarantee under section 1322a of this title on the first day of initial critical year because the increases were adopted (or, if later, took effect) less than 60 months before such first day.

  * #### (B) Normal retirement benefits protected
    * Except as provided in subparagraph (A)(iv)(III), nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to permit a plan to reduce the level of a participant's accrued benefit payable at normal retirement age.

  * #### (C) Notice requirements
    * #### (i) In general
      * No reduction may be made to adjustable benefits under subparagraph (A) unless notice of such reduction has been given at least 30 days before the general effective date of such reduction for all participants and beneficiaries to—

      * #### (I) In general
        * In the case of a plan with 10,000 or more participants, not later than 60 days prior to the plan sponsor submitting an application to suspend benefits, the plan sponsor shall select a participant of the plan in pay status to act as a retiree representative. The retiree representative shall advocate for the interests of the retired and deferred vested participants and beneficiaries of the plan throughout the suspension approval process.

      * #### (II) Reasonable expenses from plan
        * The plan shall provide for reasonable expenses by the retiree representative, including reasonable legal and actuarial support, commensurate with the plan's size and funded status.

      * #### (III) Special rule relating to fiduciary status
        * Duties performed pursuant to subclause (I) shall not be subject to section 1104(a) of this title. The preceding sentence shall not apply to those duties associated with an application to suspend benefits pursuant to subparagraph (G) that are performed by the retiree representative who is also a plan trustee.

  * #### (C) Conditions for suspensions
    * The plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status for a plan year may suspend benefits only if the following conditions are met:

      * (i) Taking into account the proposed suspensions of benefits (and, if applicable, a proposed partition of the plan under section 1413 of this title), the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency within the meaning of section 1426 of this title, assuming the suspensions of benefits continue until the suspensions of benefits expire by their own terms or if no such expiration date is set, indefinitely.

      * (ii) The plan sponsor determines, in a written record to be maintained throughout the period of the benefit suspension, that the plan is still projected to become insolvent unless benefits are suspended under this paragraph, although all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been taken (and continue to be taken during the period of the benefit suspension). In its determination, the plan sponsor may take into account factors including the following:

        * (I) Current and past contribution levels.

        * (II) Levels of benefit accruals (including any prior reductions in the rate of benefit accruals).

      * (ii)(I) In the case of a participant or beneficiary who has attained 75 years of age as of the effective date of the suspension, not more than the applicable percentage of the maximum suspendable benefits of such participant or beneficiary may be suspended under this paragraph.

      * (II) For purposes of subclause (I), the maximum suspendable benefits of a participant or beneficiary is the portion of the benefits of such participant or beneficiary that would be suspended pursuant to this paragraph without regard to this clause;

      * (III) For purposes of subclause (I), the applicable percentage is a percentage equal to the quotient obtained by dividing—

        * (aa) the number of months during the period beginning with the month after the month in which occurs the effective date of the suspension and ending with the month during which the participant or beneficiary attains the age of 80, by

        * (bb) 60 months.


      * (iii) No benefits based on disability (as defined under the plan) may be suspended under this paragraph.

      * (iv) Any suspensions of benefits, in the aggregate (and, if applicable, considered in combination with a partition of the plan under section 1413 of this title), shall be reasonably estimated to achieve, but not materially exceed, the level that is necessary to avoid insolvency.

      * (v) In any case in which a suspension of benefits with respect to a plan is made in combination with a partition of the plan under section 1413 of this title, the suspension of benefits may not take effect prior to the effective date of such partition.

      * (vi) Any suspensions of benefits shall be equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population, taking into account factors, with respect to participants and beneficiaries and their benefits, that may include one or more of the following:

        * (I) Age and life expectancy.

        * (II) Length of time in pay status.

        * (V) Extent to which participant or beneficiary is receiving a subsidized benefit.

        * (IX) Any discrepancies between active and retiree benefits.

        * (XI) Extent to which benefits are attributed to service with an employer that failed to pay its full withdrawal liability.


      * (vii) In the case of a plan that includes the benefits described in clause (III), benefits suspended under this paragraph shall—

        * (I) first, be applied to the maximum extent permissible to benefits attributable to a participant's service for an employer which withdrew from the plan and failed to pay (or is delinquent with respect to paying) the full amount of its withdrawal liability under section 1381(b)(1) of this title or an agreement with the plan,

        * (II) second, except as provided by subclause (III), be applied to all other benefits that may be suspended under this paragraph, and

        * (III) third, be applied to benefits under a plan that are directly attributable to a participant's service with any employer which has, prior to December 16, 2014—

          * (aa) withdrawn from the plan in a complete withdrawal under section 1383 of this title and has paid the full amount of the employer's withdrawal liability under section 1381(b)(1) of this title or an agreement with the plan, and

      * The plan sponsor may, in its sole discretion, provide benefit improvements while any suspension of benefits under the plan remains in effect, except that the plan sponsor may not increase the liabilities of the plan by reason of any benefit improvement for any participant or beneficiary not in pay status by the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement takes effect, unless—

        * (I) such action is accompanied by equitable benefit improvements in accordance with clause (ii) for all participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement dates were before the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement for such participant or beneficiary not in pay status took effect; and

        * (II) the plan actuary certifies that after taking into account such benefits improvements the plan is projected to avoid insolvency indefinitely under section 1426 of this title.

    * #### (ii) Equitable distribution of benefit improvements
      * #### (I) Limitation
        * The projected value of the total liabilities for benefit improvements for participants and beneficiaries not in pay status by the date of the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements are proposed to take effect, as determined as of such date, may not exceed the projected value of the liabilities arising from benefit improvements for participants and beneficiaries with benefit commencement dates prior to the first day of such plan year, as so determined.

      * #### (II) Equitable distribution of benefits
        * The plan sponsor shall equitably distribute any increase in total liabilities for benefit improvements in clause (i) to some or all of the participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement date is before the date of the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements are proposed to take effect, taking into account the relevant factors described in subparagraph (D)(vi) and the extent to which the benefits of the participants and beneficiaries were suspended.

    * #### (iii) Special rule for resumptions of benefits only for participants in pay status
      * The plan sponsor may increase liabilities of the plan through a resumption of benefits for participants and beneficiaries in pay status only if the plan sponsor equitably distributes the value of resumed benefits to some or all of the participants and beneficiaries in pay status, taking into account the relevant factors described in subparagraph (D)(vi).

    * #### (iv) Special rule for certain benefit increases
      * This subparagraph shall not apply to a resumption of suspended benefits or plan amendment which increases liabilities with respect to participants and beneficiaries not in pay status by the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements took effect which—

        * (I) the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, determines to be reasonable and which provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan, or

        * (II) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of subtitle A of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

    * #### (v) Additional limitations

Except as provided in clause (v), the suspension shall go into effect following the vote unless a majority of all participants and beneficiaries of the plan vote to reject the suspension. The plan sponsor may submit a new suspension application to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval in any case in which a suspension is prohibited from taking effect pursuant to a vote under this subparagraph.

    * #### (iii) Ballots
      * The plan sponsor shall provide a ballot for the vote (subject to approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor) that includes the following:

        * (I) A statement from the plan sponsor in support of the suspension.

        * (II) A statement in opposition to the suspension compiled from comments received pursuant to subparagraph (G)(ii).

        * (III) A statement that the suspension has been approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor.

        * (VI) A statement that insolvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would result in benefits lower than benefits paid in the case of plan insolvency.

    * #### (iv) Communication by plan sponsor
      * It is the sense of Congress that, depending on the size and resources of the plan and geographic distribution of the plan's participants, the plan sponsor should take such steps as may be necessary to inform participants about proposed benefit suspensions through in-person meetings, telephone or internet-based communications, mailed information, or by other means.

    * #### (v) Systemically important plans
      * #### (I) In general
        * Not later than 14 days after a vote under this subparagraph rejecting a suspension, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall determine whether the plan is a systemically important plan. If the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, determines that the plan is a systemically important plan, not later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date the results of the vote are certified, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, notwithstanding such adverse vote—

          * (aa) permit the implementation of the suspension proposed by the plan sponsor; or

          * (bb) permit the implementation of a modification by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, of such suspension (so long as the plan is projected to avoid insolvency within the meaning of section 1426 of this title under such modification).

      * #### (II) Recommendations

        * #### (bb) Indexing
          * For calendar years beginning after 2015, there shall be substituted for the dollar amount specified in item (aa) an amount equal to the product of such dollar amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 430 of title 42) for the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is such contribution and benefit base for calendar year 2014. If the amount otherwise determined under this item is not a multiple of $1,000,000, such amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $1,000,000.

    * #### (vi) Final authorization to suspend
      * In any case in which a suspension goes into effect following a vote pursuant to clause (ii) (or following a determination under clause (v) that the plan is a systemically important plan), the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall issue a final authorization to suspend with respect to the suspension not later than 7 days after such vote (or, in the case of a suspension that goes into effect under clause (v), at a time sufficient to allow the implementation of the suspension prior to the end of the 90-day period described in clause (v)(I)).

  * #### (I) Judicial review

* #### (2) Nonbargained employees only
  * In the case of an employer that contributes to a multiemployer plan only with respect to employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, this section shall be applied as if the employer were the bargaining party, and its participation agreement with the plan were a collective bargaining agreement with a term ending on the first day of the plan year beginning after the employer is provided the schedule or schedules described in subsections (c) and (e).
