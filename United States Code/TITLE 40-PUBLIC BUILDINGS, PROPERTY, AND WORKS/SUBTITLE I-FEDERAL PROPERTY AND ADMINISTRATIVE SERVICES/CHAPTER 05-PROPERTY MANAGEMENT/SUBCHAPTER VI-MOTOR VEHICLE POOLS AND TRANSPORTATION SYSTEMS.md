### §603. Process for establishing motor vehicle pools and transportation systems
* (a) DETERMINATION REQUIREMENT.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator of General Services may carry out section 602 only if the Administrator determines, after consultation with the agencies concerned and with due regard to their program activities, that doing so is advantageous to the Federal Government in terms of economy, efficiency, or service.

  * (2) ELEMENTS OF THE DETERMINATION.—A determination under this section must be in writing. For each motor vehicle pool or system, the determination must set forth an analytical justification that includes—

    * (A) a detailed comparison of estimated costs for present and proposed modes of operation; and

    * (B) a showing that savings can be realized by the establishment, maintenance, and operation of a motor vehicle pool or system.


* (b) REGULATIONS RELATED TO ESTABLISHMENT.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—The President shall prescribe regulations establishing procedures to carry out section 602 of this title.

  * (2) ELEMENTS OF THE REGULATIONS.—The regulations shall provide for—

    * (A) adequate notice to an executive agency of any determination that affects the agency or its functions;

    * (B) independent review and decision as directed by the President of any determination disputed by an agency, with the possibility that the decision may include a partial or complete exemption of the agency from the determination; and

    * (C) enforcement of determinations that become effective under the regulations.


  * (3) EFFECT OF THE REGULATIONS.—A determination under subsection (a) is binding on an agency only as provided in regulations issued under this subsection.

### §604. Treatment of assets taken over to establish motor vehicle pools and transportation systems
* (a) REIMBURSEMENT.—

  * (1) REQUIREMENT.—When the Administrator of General Services takes over motor vehicles or related equipment or supplies under section 602 of this title, reimbursement is required if the property is taken over from—

    * (A) a Government corporation; or

    * (B) an agency, if the agency acquired the property through unreimbursed expenditures made from a revolving or trust fund authorized by law.


  * (2) AMOUNT.—The Administrator shall reimburse a Government corporation, or a fund through which an agency acquired property, by an amount equal to the fair market value of the property. If the Administrator subsequently returns property of a similar kind under section 610 of this title, the Government corporation or the fund shall reimburse the Administrator by an amount equal to the fair market value of the property returned.


* (b) ADDITION TO ACQUISITION SERVICES FUND.—If the Administrator takes over motor vehicles or related equipment or supplies under section 602 of this title but reimbursement is not required under subsection (a), the value of the property taken over, as determined by the Administrator, may be added to the capital of the Acquisition Services Fund. If the Administrator subsequently returns property of a similar kind under section 610 of this title, the value of the property may be deducted from the Fund.

### §605. Payment of costs
* (a) USE OF ACQUISITION SERVICES FUND TO COVER COSTS.—The Acquisition Services Fund provided for in section 321 of this title is available for use by or under the direction and control of the Administrator of General Services to pay the costs of carrying out section 602 of this title, including the cost of purchasing or renting motor vehicles and related equipment and supplies.

Notwithstanding section 321(f) of this title, the increment may be retained as a part of the capital of the Acquisition Services Fund but is available only to replace motor vehicles and related equipment and supplies.


* (c) ACCOUNTING METHOD.—The purchase price of motor vehicles and related equipment, and any increment for estimated replacement cost, shall be recovered only through charges for the cost of amortization. Costs shall be determined, and financial reports prepared, in accordance with the accrual accounting method.

### §606. Regulations related to operation

  * (2) the legend "For official use only".


* (b) EXCEPTIONS.—The regulations prescribed pursuant to this section may provide for exemptions when conspicuous identification would interfere with the purpose for which a vehicle is acquired and used.

### §610. Discontinuance of motor vehicle pool or system
* (a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator of General Services shall discontinue a motor vehicle pool or system if there are no actual savings realized (based on accounting as provided in section 605 of this title) during a reasonable period of not longer than two successive fiscal years.
