  * (2) REQUEST FOR OPINION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.—A department or agency of the Government that has been delegated the responsibility to approve land titles under this section may request the Attorney General to render an opinion as to the validity of the title to any real property or interest in the property, or may request the advice or assistance of the Attorney General in connection with determinations as to the sufficiency of titles.


* (c) PAYMENT OF EXPENSES FOR PROCURING CERTIFICATES OF TITLE.—Except where otherwise authorized by law or provided by contract, the expenses of procuring certificates of titles or other evidences of title as the Attorney General may require may be paid out of the appropriations for the acquisition of land or out of the appropriations made for the contingencies of the acquiring department or agency of the Government.

The individual shall indicate acceptance of jurisdiction on behalf of the Government by filing a notice of acceptance with the Governor of the State or in another manner prescribed by the laws of the State where the land is situated.

### §3113. Acquisition by condemnation

### §3114. Declaration of taking
* (a) FILING AND CONTENT.—In any proceeding in any court of the United States outside of the District of Columbia brought by and in the name of the United States and under the authority of the Federal Government to acquire land, or an easement or right of way in land, for the public use, the petitioner may file, with the petition or at any time before judgment, a declaration of taking signed by the authority empowered by law to acquire the land described in the petition, declaring that the land is taken for the use of the Government. The declaration of taking shall contain or have annexed to it—

  * (1) a statement of the authority under which, and the public use for which, the land is taken;

  * (3) the right to just compensation for the land vests in the persons entitled to the compensation.


* (c) COMPENSATION.—

  * (1) DETERMINATION AND AWARD.—Compensation shall be determined and awarded in the proceeding and established by judgment. The judgment shall include interest, in accordance with section 3116 of this title, on the amount finally awarded as the value of the property as of the date of taking and shall be awarded from that date to the date of payment. Interest shall not be allowed on as much of the compensation as has been paid into the court. Amounts paid into the court shall not be charged with commissions or poundage.

  * (2) may make just and equitable orders in respect of encumbrances, liens, rents, taxes, assessments, insurance, and other charges.


* (e) VESTING NOT PREVENTED OR DELAYED.—An appeal or a bond or undertaking given in a proceeding does not prevent or delay the vesting of title to land in the Government.

### §3115. Irrevocable commitment of Federal Government to pay ultimate award when fixed
* (a) REQUIREMENT FOR IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT.—Action under section 3114 of this title irrevocably committing the Federal Government to the payment of the ultimate award shall not be taken unless the head of the executive department or agency or bureau of the Government empowered to acquire the land believes that the ultimate award probably will be within any limits Congress prescribes on the price to be paid.

* (b) AUTHORIZED PURPOSES OF EXPENDITURES AFTER IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT MADE.—When the Government has taken or may take title to real property during a condemnation proceeding and in advance of final judgment in the proceeding and has become irrevocably committed to pay the amount ultimately to be awarded as compensation, and the Attorney General believes that title to the property has been vested in the Government or that all persons having an interest in the property have been made parties to the proceeding and will be bound by the final judgment, the Government may expend amounts appropriated for that purpose to demolish existing structures on the property and to erect public buildings or public works on the property.

### §3116. Interest as part of just compensation
* (a) CALCULATION.—The district court shall calculate interest required to be paid under this subchapter as follows:

  * (1) PERIOD OF NOT MORE THAN ONE YEAR.—Where the period for which interest is owed is not more than one year, interest shall be calculated from the date of taking at an annual rate equal to the weekly average one-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week preceding the date of taking.

  * (2) PERIOD OF MORE THAN ONE YEAR.—Where the period for which interest is owed is more than one year, interest for the first year shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (1) and interest for each additional year shall be calculated on the amount by which the award of compensation is more than the deposit referred to in section 3114 of this title, plus accrued interest, at an annual rate equal to the weekly average one-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week preceding the beginning of each additional year.

### §3118. Right of taking as addition to existing rights
* The right to take possession and title in advance of final judgment in condemnation proceedings as provided by section 3114 of this title is in addition to any right, power, or authority conferred by the laws of the United States or of a State, territory, or possession of the United States under which the proceeding may be conducted, and does not abrogate, limit, or modify that right, power, or authority.
