### SUBCHAPTER IV—ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF LAND

### §8731. Acquiring land for park, parkway, or playground purposes
* (a) AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE LAND.—The National Capitol Planning Commission shall acquire land the Planning Commission believes is necessary and desirable in the District of Columbia and adjacent areas in Maryland and Virginia for suitable development of the National Capital park, parkway, and playground system. The acquisition must be within the limits of the appropriations made for those purposes. The Planning Commission shall request the advice of the Commission of Fine Arts in selecting land to be acquired.

* (b) HOW LAND MAY BE ACQUIRED.—

  * (1) PURCHASE OR CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING.—The National Capital Planning Commission may buy land when the land can be acquired at a price the Planning Commission considers reasonable or by a condemnation proceeding when the land cannot be bought at a reasonable price.

  * (2) LAND IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.—A condemnation proceeding to acquire land in the District of Columbia shall be conducted in accordance with section 1 of the Act of December 23, 1963 (Public Law 88–241, 77 Stat. 571).

  * (3) LAND IN MARYLAND OR VIRGINIA.—The Planning Commission may acquire land in Maryland or Virginia under arrangements agreed to by the Commission and the proper officials of Maryland or Virginia.


* (c) CONTROL OF LAND.—

  * (1) LAND IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.—Land acquired in the District of Columbia shall be a part of the park system of the District of Columbia and be under the control of the Director of the National Park Service. The National Capital Planning Commission may assign areas suitable for playground purposes to the control of the Mayor of the District of Columbia for playground purposes.

  * (2) LAND IN MARYLAND OR VIRGINIA.—Land acquired in Maryland or Virginia shall be controlled as determined by agreement between the Planning Commission and the proper officials of Maryland or Virginia.


* (d) PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL REQUIRED.—The designation of all land to be acquired by condemnation, all contracts to purchase land, and all agreements between the National Capital Planning Commission and the officials of Maryland and Virginia are subject to the approval of the President.

### §8732. Acquiring land subject to limited rights reserved to grantor and limited permanent rights in land adjoining park property
* (a) IN GENERAL.—The National Capital Planning Commission in accordance with this chapter may acquire, for and on behalf of the Federal Government, by gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation—

  * (1) fee title to land subject to limited rights, but not for business purposes, reserved to the grantor; and

  * (2) permanent rights in land adjoining park property sufficient to prevent the use of the land in certain specified ways which would essentially impair the value of the park property for its purposes.


* (b) PREREQUISITES TO ACQUISITION.—

  * (1) FEE TITLE TO LAND SUBJECT TO LIMITED RIGHTS.—The reservation of rights to the grantor shall not continue beyond the life of the grantor of the fee. The Commission must decide that the permanent public park purposes for which control over the land is needed are not essentially impaired by the reserved rights and that there is a substantial saving in cost by acquiring the land subject to the limited rights as compared with the cost of acquiring unencumbered title to the land.

  * (2) PERMANENT RIGHTS IN LAND ADJOINING PARK PROPERTY.—The Commission must decide that the protection and maintenance of the essential public values of the park can be secured more economically by acquiring the permanent rights than by acquiring the land.


* (c) PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL REQUIRED.—All contracts to acquire land or rights under this section are subject to the approval of the President.

### §8733. Lease of land acquired for park, parkway, or playground purposes
* The Secretary of the Interior may lease, for not more than five years, land or an existing building or structure on land acquired for park, parkway, or playground purposes, and may renew the lease for an additional five years. A lease or renewal under this section is—

  * (1) subject to the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission;

  * (2) subject to the need for the immediate use of the land, building, or structure in other ways by the public; and

  * (3) on terms the Administrator decides.

### §8734. Sale of land by Mayor
* (a) AUTHORITY TO SELL.—With the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, for the best interests of the District of Columbia, may sell to the highest bidder at public or private sale real estate in the District of Columbia owned in fee simple by the District of Columbia for municipal use that the Council of the District of Columbia and the Commission find to be no longer required for public purposes.

* (b) PAYING EXPENSES AND DEPOSITING PROCEEDS.—The Mayor—

  * (1) may pay the reasonable and necessary expenses of the sale of each parcel of land sold; and

  * (2) shall deposit the net proceeds of each sale in the Treasury to the credit of the District of Columbia.

### §8735. Sale of land by Secretary of the Interior
* (a) AUTHORITY TO SELL.—With the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission, the Secretary of the Interior, for the best interests of the Federal Government, may sell, by deed or instrument, real estate held by the Government in the District of Columbia and under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service which may be no longer needed for public purposes. The land may be sold for cash or on a deferred-payment plan the Secretary approves, at a price not less than the Government paid for it and not less than its present appraised value as determined by the Secretary.

* (b) SALE TO HIGHEST BIDDER.—In selling any parcel of land under this section, the Secretary shall have public or private solicitation for bids or offers be made as the Secretary considers appropriate. The Secretary shall sell the parcel to the party agreeing to pay the highest price if the price is otherwise satisfactory. If the price offered or bid by the owner of land abutting the land to be sold equals the highest price offered or bid by any other party, the parcel may be sold to the owner of the abutting land.

* (c) PAYING EXPENSES AND DEPOSITING PROCEEDS.—The Secretary—

  * (1) may pay the reasonable and necessary expenses of the sale of each parcel of land sold; and

  * (2) shall deposit the net proceeds of each sale in the Treasury to the credit of the Government and the District of Columbia in the proportion that each—

    * (A) paid the appropriations used to acquire the parcels; or

    * (B) was obligated to pay the appropriations, at the time of acquisition, by reimbursement.

### §8736. Execution of deeds
* The Mayor of the District of Columbia may execute deeds of conveyance for real estate sold under this subchapter. The deeds shall contain a full description of the land sold as required by law.

### §8737. Authorization of appropriations
* An amount equal to not more than one cent for each inhabitant of the continental United States as determined by the last preceding decennial census may be appropriated each year in the District of Columbia Appropriation Act for the National Capital Planning Commission to use for the payment of its expenses and for the acquisition of land the Commission may acquire under section 8731 of this title for the purposes named, including compensation for the land, surveys, ascertainment of title, condemnation proceedings, and necessary conveyancing. The appropriated amounts shall be paid from the revenues of the District of Columbia and the general amounts of the Treasury in the same proportion as other expenses of the District of Columbia.
