  * (3) involve other nations to the extent appropriate.

### §20302. Vision for space exploration
* (a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall establish a program to develop a sustained human presence in cis-lunar space or on the Moon, including a robust precursor program, to promote exploration, science, commerce, and United States preeminence in space, and as a stepping-stone to future exploration of Mars and other destinations. The Administrator is further authorized to develop and conduct appropriate international collaborations in pursuit of these goals.

* (b) FUTURE EXPLORATION OF MARS.—The Administrator shall manage human space flight programs, including the Space Launch System and Orion, to enable humans to explore Mars and other destinations by defining a series of sustainable steps and conducting mission planning, research, and technology development on a timetable that is technically and fiscally possible, consistent with section 70504.

* (c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:

  * (1) ORION.—The term "Orion" means the multipurpose crew vehicle described under section 303 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18323).

  * (2) SPACE LAUNCH SYSTEM.—The term "Space Launch System" means has the meaning given the term in section 3 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18302).

### §20303. Contribution to innovation
* (a) PARTICIPATION IN INTERAGENCY ACTIVITIES.—The Administration shall be a full participant in any interagency effort to promote innovation and economic competitiveness through near-term and long-term basic scientific research and development and the promotion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education, consistent with the Administration's mission, including authorized activities.

* (b) HISTORIC FOUNDATION.—In order to carry out the participation described in subsection (a), the Administrator shall build on the historic role of the Administration in stimulating excellence in the advancement of physical science and engineering disciplines and in providing opportunities and incentives for the pursuit of academic studies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

* (c) BALANCED SCIENCE PROGRAM AND ROBUST AUTHORIZATION LEVELS.—The balanced science program authorized by section 101(d) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16611(d)) shall be an element of the contribution by the Administration to the interagency programs.

* (d) ANNUAL REPORT.—

  * (1) REQUIREMENT.—The Administrator shall submit to Congress and the President an annual report describing the activities conducted pursuant to this section, including a description of the goals and the objective metrics upon which funding decisions were made.

  * (2) CONTENT.—Each report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall include, with regard to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education programs, at a minimum, the following:

    * (A) A description of each program.

    * (B) The amount spent on each program.

    * (C) The number of students or teachers served by each program.

### §20304. Basic research enhancement
* (a) DEFINITION OF BASIC RESEARCH.—In this section, the term "basic research" has the meaning given the term in Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A–11.

* (b) COORDINATION.—The Administrator, the Director of the National Science Foundation, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Commerce shall, to the extent practicable, coordinate basic research activities related to physical sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

### §20305. National Academies decadal surveys
* (a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall enter into agreements on a periodic basis with the National Academies for independent assessments, also known as decadal surveys, to take stock of the status and opportunities for Earth and space science discipline fields and Aeronautics research and to recommend priorities for research and programmatic areas over the next decade.

* (b) INDEPENDENT COST ESTIMATES.—The agreements described in subsection (a) shall include independent estimates of the life cycle costs and technical readiness of missions assessed in the decadal surveys whenever possible.

* (c) REEXAMINATION.—The Administrator shall request that each National Academies decadal survey committee identify any conditions or events, such as significant cost growth or scientific or technological advances, that would warrant the Administration asking the National Academies to reexamine the priorities that the decadal survey had established.
