* (4) In the case of an officer whose retired pay is computed on the pay of a grade for which basic pay is not based upon years of service, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed on the basis of the number of years of service for which the officer would be entitled to credit in the computation of pay on the active list had the officer been serving in the grade of captain at the time of retirement.
